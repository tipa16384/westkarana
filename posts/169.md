Whilst perusing (it's important to use Britlish when talking about) [the BBC NEWS website](http://news.bbc.co.uk), I read an article about blogging; in particular their own blog. [Down With Blogs!](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5116654.stm) they screamed. Including their own. But what was this mention of something called "Pooterism"?

> Journalists have their own takes on blogs - broadcaster Mark Lawson, for one, says that "although the word blog suggests attitude and subversion, it's really just a hi-tech kind of diary and carries the identical risk of Pooterism".


Went to Google, typed "define Pooterism", and it eventually led me to [Wikipedia's entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary_of_a_Nobody) on [The Diary of a Nobody](http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext97/dnbdy10h.htm).

Pooterism, you see, is the publishing publically of the details of your life, even though nobody really cares. That's blogging in a nutshell! Well, the type of blogs, like this one, which isn't just made of pointers to news stories... well, as this article is. From the forward to the "Diary of a Nobody"...

> Why should I not publish my diary? I have often seen reminiscences of people I have never even heard of, and I fail to see
