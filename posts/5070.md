#Wizard101: Advanced Pets Preview#

I'm not sure how I missed this fantastic video of the new pet games (and more!) coming with the next huge content update for Wizard101 (and thanks to Sierra Starsong at [Modern Automagic](http://www.modernautomagic.com/2010/04/breaking-news.html) for the heads-up!)

This adds the feature I have been wanting for YEARS (well, maybe just a year) -- letting my pets roam free. Plus pet races and other pet games.... This is Wizard101 moving into Free Realms territory. I'm all for it!

[Here's the full announcement](https://www.wizard101.com/game/advancedpowerpets) on the Wizard101 site -- check it out!
