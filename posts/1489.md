Click this and [sign up for the beta](http://www.searchme.com/beta/ars) --

It's a signup for a closed beta for a search engine with a "coverflow" display, looks really cool, goes on the theory that if you could shuffle through the websites returned from a search, you could find the one you're looking for fast.

They only have < 300 beta invites left, and it was a lot higher when I got mine, so I am not going to write a lot about it. Just go get in the beta and let me know how it works for ya.
