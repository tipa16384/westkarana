# Wizard101: Ambrose flees the spiral, leaves cryptic recording

Students and faculty alike were shocked this afternoon when Merle Ambrose, Headmaster of Wizard City's prestigious Ravenwood Academy, left the Spiral and led police on a merry chase through the streets of Austin. 

He left behind a cryptic recording. Close friends Gamma and Bartleby have refused to comment. Austin commuters report a second person in the car with the headmaster; descriptions match that of villain Malistaire Drake's long dead wife, Sylvia. If the reports are correct, Sylvia Drake's death may have been faked.

Repeat: Headmaster Ambrose has left the Spiral....
