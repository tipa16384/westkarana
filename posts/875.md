# TV continued: IT Crowd, second series

Talk about synchronicity! I do a post about television I've been watching, and today I hear that the [second series](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/08/25/the_it_crowd_season_.html) of the incredible "The IT Crowd" has started. I've been showing the first series to anyone who comes over and sits down long enough to watch.

I'll post more once I've had a chance to see it. The first series will be out on DVD in the US in September. It's classic.

(While looking for an Amazon link to the DVD, I found it's been [pushed back to February, 2008](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IT_Crowd#DVD), to coincide with the American version of the show (with Richard Ayoade reprising his role as Moss). Maybe they'll put the second series on it as well. And for all the hardcore geeks -- it's okay, they thought of us. [The subtitles are in L33T](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/15/it_crowd_dvd_has_sub.html).)
