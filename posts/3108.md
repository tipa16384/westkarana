# Shards of Dalaya blog: Dalayan Diary

I'd heard wonderful things about [Shards of Dalaya](http://www.shardsofdalaya.com/), a game built on EverQuest's assets (and using the EverQuest client) but with a different plot, zone names, zone connections and so on. SOE knows about it and turns a blind eye to it for reasons of their own.

Nonetheless, even with the changes, Dalaya gives a fairly nostalgic look back to the simplicity and danger of old EverQuest, and though I realized I wasn't as interested in the pure vanilla old school experience as I thought it was (half an hour to level 2? Madness!), the community is passionate and enthusiastic and active development on the game continues.

Ramon AKA Psyq123 started a couple of characters on Shards of Dalaya and writes about it on his new blog, [Dalayan Diary](http://dalayan.wordpress.com/). Even though SoD is not quite EverQuest classic, it really does bring me back to 1999 when I rolled my first character, an Erudite Wizard, and stepped into the Stygian darkness of Toxxulia Forest.

Great reading :)
