This is my Burynai. His name is Dalnir! When I feed him, he acts like he's coughing up a hairball, but it's really collectible items. I got a Crushed Scorpion (ewww) and a Rivervale Scroll from the foods I had on me.

I was so happy to see I could claim him -- I just hadn't looked far enough up in the list.

I took my alts out of my main guild's alt guild, "E C Bots". That name is just embarrassing; a joke someone thought was funny, but just try to be taken seriously in a group when you have that name hovering over you. I asked in guild if there was an alt guild I could join my crafters to, since I will be grinding writs and would like that effort to go to leveling a real guild. The guild leader mentioned "E C Bots", but, um, no. I know that very few alts join that guild. I see people's alts in half a dozen other guilds, and I was looking for an invite into one of those.

I got a tell from a guildie who had an alt guild *precisely* to avoid being branded a twink, and so I joined all my crafters to that. When I get to leveling my jeweler to 80, I won't feel that effort is wasted now.

The beta is still running, for some reason. I accidentally logged into it last night. Looking at the guild's events log, I saw there were several people being buffed to 80 and given the fabled set gear, perhaps to test some things out, so I used the dressing room to capture some of those sets -- pictures of them after the jump.

There were others, but nobody had thought to do a troubador. Someday, we'll be flavor of the month again!
