# EQ: The Serpent Spine and Why I Hate the Grind

After I transferred Tsuki the Mage to Stromm, I made Tsuki the Necromancer on Erollisi Marr to save her name if I ever needed to bring her back. Groups were a lot of fun, when I could get them -- at this time, there were still plenty of low level groups, and I was getting groups in the Overthere and Echo Caverns regularly. I usually played alts wen I couldn't find a group with my main, but after long enough without groups for my mains, I tend to wander off to other games. I was leveling Tsuki the Necro fairly regularly when groups became nearly impossible to find on my cleric, and so I went to World of Warcraft, and all my EQ1 alts have been in limbo since.

I've been peeking into EQ1 more and more lately, trying to find a character -- any character -- that I remember how to play.

Necros are fairly easy to play -- snare-fear-dotdotdot, or the other way around, so I thought maybe I could hack it while I remembered the controls. Well, no. I am so used to knowing how things con by looking at their names that I made a little mistake and attacked one of the guards in West Karana (isn't it great how that zone keeps popping up?), and he brought friends, they took down my pet and I failed my feign. Now I could get up and try it again -- if I could have remembered the keystroke to stand up again. I didn't, so I died, rezzed in the guild lobby, and used a veteran reward to summon and autorez my corpse. That's on a one-week cooldown.

I have never been through the Serpent's Spine expansion, so I thought I would go there -- it's meant for all levels, after all. From the stone in PoK, I appeared in an area full of green-con wolves. I immediately set to fear kiting, everything is going fine until this WITCH comes up and turns me into a NEWT.

No, really.

I got better, though. 

Luckily, Feign Death worked this time. There's the witch there in the screenshot. Ugly biddy.

No groups for a 39 necro that I could see, though I did notice while I was up in PoK that Reviction is looking for a cleric. Well, an 80 cleric. I don't know if I want to learn how to play a cleric again, level to 80 somehow, just to play a game I have left at least three times. Also I believe I would need about 150 more AAs. And I *hate* grinding, I just won't do it. When the grindy part of the game comes, I quit. I refuse to support that kind of stupid game mechanic -- and if everyone protested the grind by quitting the game, then devs would see the light. It's a game. It's SUPPOSED to be fun. I only spent a very little time grinding in EQ. I lacked in AAs and gear but I always had fun. When it stopped being fun -- ta ta. I quit WoW when grinding became required to raid or to make my tier 0.5 armor. I almost quit EQ2 when they required me to pretty much solo ten levels in a grindy fashion (and I should have quit, since by continuing to play, SOE might get the idea that this grinding thing is something they should include more of, more often).

Anyway. Since I've stopped being able to find groups in EQ2, my time in that game may be drawing to an end. Playing by myself is no fun at all... so I may try EQ for a little while until something new comes along.
