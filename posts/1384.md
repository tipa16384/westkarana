# Sympathy for the Daniel

There's a boy out there, crying in shame because he cannot understand blogs.

He needs all our help.

His name is [Daniel](mailto:k.daniel@msn.com).

And he cannot understand blogs.


> I couldn’t understand some parts of this article rana » EQ2: Nice while it lasted — Clan of Shadows declines the haffer, but I guess I just need to check some more resources regarding this, because it sounds interesting.



He's one of my biggest fans, and he reads everything I write, but there's always some part of my post he can't understand. He always promises to try harder, to do more research, but before he can finish, I write something new and it was all for nothing after all.

It's back to the beginning for poor Daniel.

I am worried, though, that he'll see his name here and eagerly wonder what I'm saying about him, but then get bogged down in all the words and have to leave to do more research.

We're here for you, Daniel.

Don't be a stranger.
