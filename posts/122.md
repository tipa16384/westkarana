# MythTV: Death of Glyph

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-03-31 00:00:00*

My struggle to remember to watch TV continues. Last night, I installed [MythTV](http://mythtv.org) on my [Linux](http://www.gentoo.org/) box, [Baphomet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baphomet). MythTV is an open source, free software solution to give [Tivo](http://www.tivo.com/)-like capability to computers of all sorts. I don't have a [video capture card](http://www.hauppauge.com/) yet, but I went ahead and installed it anyway. Brought up the [program guide](http://www.zap2it.com/) and wow, there are LOTS of shows I would like to watch! [Anime](http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/), [Simpsons](http://www.thesimpsons.com/), [Family Guy](http://www.familyguy.com/), SF shows I never saw before, just bunches and bunches of things.

Going to make [this cable thing](http://www.cox.com/) work for me.

I was going to make an entirely new computer for MythTV and put it in the living room. But, let's face it. 75% of the time I am home and not doing chores, I am [at](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/) [my](http://www.everquest2.com) [computer](http://www.everquest.com)... the other 25% is playing [Guitar Hero](http://www.guitarherogame.com) in the living room*. I don't watch TV much in the living room, probably because I haven't bought a couch yet.

Anyway, current plan should save money *and* match the way I live. I will add a video capture card to Baphomet so she can watch [television](http://sony.com) for me automatically, and save the bits she thinks I'll want to watch later. Baph is online all day anyway, because I often [connect from work](http://www.putty.nl/) to do [various](http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/ping.html) [things](http://linuxreviews.org/software/p2p/bittorrent/).

Phase 2 deals with poor Glyph. Glyph was to be my living room computer, that would watch TV for me, save stuff, and so on. But I just can't justify the cost of a whole new computer if all I am going to be doing now is streaming video to it.

Wonderfully, Xbox's can run Linux. They turn out to be perfect front-ends to MythTV as well. They have all the right connectors. I'm not exactly sure how the Xbox and Baph would connect - to be honest, I know next to nothing about it. I'm a Sony fan, so Playstation all the way here.

My problem with the Xbox is emotional. It's such a male machine. I worry that having that man sitting in the living room all day will become a problem. Beer cans all over the place. Toilet seat left up. Loud friends over all the time.

I've never been able to look at an Xbox without seeing a gun. My son had one. All they did was shoot people with it.

* After unlocking and mastering all fifteen of the bonus songs on [Guitar Hero](http://www.guitarherogame.com)'s MEDIUM level, I decided to buckle down and go to work on HARD level. It's, well... HARD! And there's EXPERT after that! Reading about Nintendo's [BRAIN AGE](http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=tYVqJgro-KG6QL_mMbXFoQTkQIzgi9nU) at [GDC](http://www.gdconf.com/) made me wonder if my mind is getting old... I already know I cannot do the mental things I could do when I was younger.... well, I do need to keep pushing. I really enjoy GH, but the past few nights, I have been stagnating at MEDIUM. Need to keep growing.

When I went back and rewarded myself with some MEDIUM-level time after doing several HARD songs, the MEDIUM seemed so slow... and elementary... I haven't dared look at EXPERT songs yet. I can just guess at the screen full of symbols, like [DDR](http://www.ddrfreak.com/) on the harder modes.
