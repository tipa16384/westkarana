# Rock Band destroyed my ability to listen to rock.

I just finished listening to "Rose Colored Glasses" by [Animal Logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Logic_(band)) -- one of my favorite songs by one of my favorite bands.

And I didn't enjoy it at all.

See, that's Stewart Copeland, of The Police, on drums. And his drums are so complicated and intricate that I only hear the drums... Stanley Clarke's bass, gone. Deborah Holland's voice -- I don't hear it.

All I hear is the pounding of the drums.

Sometimes a song comes up with really crappy drums. And I like those songs -- I can relax and enjoy them without trying to figure out how to play the drum part and knowing I will never be able to.

Ah, a Tubes song came on. Joy. "Amnesia" -- how appropriate. I could play this song in my sleep :)

Guitar Hero supposedly got a lot of people into guitars. Rock Band is going to send a crowd of bleary-eyed newbie drummers to the music store.

They don't really need to run there just yet, though. The Rock Band drum kit is a *real* electronic drum kit -- you can just plug it into your computer (some drivers may be needed), feed it into a synthesizer filled with drum patches and play whatever you want.

How long before someone takes the Rock Band kit on a real stage? Not long, I bet.
