Picture is Maxfield Parrish' 1922 masterpiece, "Daybreak". Dad had bought an old print of that from SOMEWHERE and we had it above our mantle as long as I can remember. I used to think of stories behind that picture. The true story, that it was a painting done specifically to be reproduced using the then-new CYMK four color lithography process, never occurred to me.
