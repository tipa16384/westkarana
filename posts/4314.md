Fourth time through the Master/Hard tower, the big baddy drops the Spider Golem, which would be the yellow character there.

WOOT! I now have one of the rarest pets in the game!

NOW what do I do with my life?

Well, I went back to taking Marissa and Allison through Marleybone... Working on Knight's Court now. I can feel the wonderfulness of Katzenstein's Lab coming closer and closer... and then I'll go back to Grizzleheim, I promise. But I have to go see Doc Katz first!
