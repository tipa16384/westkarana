# Straight Talk Warhammer: The White Lion profession.

Warhammer Online. Warhammer. WAR. WAAAAGH. All ways to describe the game sweeping our interwebs in ways Google can easily find. More? Public quests? This game has public quests. Tome of Knowledge? This is the ONLY GAME with a Tome of Knowledge. World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King, coming this November, does not have public quests OR a Tome of Knowledge. Order. Destruction. War everywhere becomes WAR everywhere.

Public quests and the Tome of Knowledge and Order and Destruction and Realm vs Realm -- things every game, such as Blizzard's World of Warcraft, and its upcoming Wrath of the Lich King expansion, will soon have in abundance. Soon, EA Mythic's Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning will no longer be able to call public quests, and the Tome of Knowledge, something exclusive only to WAR.

But we come here tonight not to talk about such things as public quests and the Tome of Knowledge, things exclusive to Warhammer Online, but about things you won't find on many other blogs. Like information about the White Lion profession, a profession you won't find in World of Warcraft, or Lord of the Rings Online's Mines of Moria expansion, or in Star Wars: Galaxies' Hoth expansion.

Well, maybe there. But Hoth won't have Greenskins. WAAAAAGH! So that will be another thing not found in other games, except for World of Warcraft.

Well, the White Lions are high elves, and they are so incredibly ferocious, that they hunt with white lions, and wear white lion clothes, and probably sleep with the damn things, I don't know. Actually, let's just get some things about them out in the open.

These are bad muthas. I mean it. The other high elves, they don't want to be around White Lions that much. Because there's this imaginary line, and the other high elves are on THIS side of it, and the White Lions are so far on the OTHER side of it, that they don't even know there IS a line. While the other High Elves are sipping blood wine from crystal goblets in their high marble towers, the White Lion guys are running howling naked through the forest.

These are scary guys.

When a high elf kid says, "Ma, they had a White Lion guy come by Elf School and I kinda liked what he had to say," there is no discussion. High Elf law is really clear on this. Once your kid starts talking about the White Lions, you have to drop them off at a big bin in front of the White Lion union hall, and some guy in a parka comes by and collects them each night just after sundown, and then if you ever see your kid again, you won't recognize him. 'Cause they'll have that scary, wild look in their eyes, and you might want to say, "Honey? Is that you?" but you don't, because you don't want your throat ripped out by your own demon spawn.

*Thinking about becoming a White Lion? Say hello to your girlfriend.*

In battle, everyone just kinda backs away from the White Lion, and nobody dares look into his eye, because that will be the first one they come for. But while the White Lion is feeding on your buddy, that's your chance to circle around back and take him down with a swift stroke. But save one for his lion girlfriend.

We hope you have enjoyed this exclusive peak at one of Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning's most exciting new classes, and that you'll come back every day this week for more exclusive coverage of EA Mythic's groundbreakingly innovative new MMO sensation.
