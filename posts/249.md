#EQ Taking Aim at WoW#

I was reading about the new DAoC expansion on MMORPG.com and noticed this animated ad for EverQuest. A direct shot at World of Warcraft players who got to 60 and wonder - now what? The general feeling I get from people in WoW and EQ2 is that the next generation MMO champ title is Vanguard's to win or lose. I don't see a huge swell of support for returning to EverQuest.

That may be premature, though, as EQ is about to release its latest expansion, with a whole new progression path from level 1 through 75. This is probably the last, best chance to get in on the EQ experience, assuming you're not already doing it on the new progression servers.
