#Wizard 101 shared bank! Green clothes! Voices!#

Wizard 101 added shared bank slots, voice overs to all quests in Wizard City and Krokotopia, and the St Patrick's Day RMT gear in today's patch. Gamer's Daily News has [a full description](http://www.gamersdailynews.com/story-9426-Wizard101-Finds-Its-Voice.html) of the new changes, and I'll be posting all the details after I get into the game tonight.

Thanks to [Game Mom](http://twitter.com/gamemom) for the heads-up!
