# The Weighted Companion Cube is your only friend.

I was thinking... ya know, I'd like to do some fan art with Portal's Weighted Companion Cube, but I couldn't find a model of one that worked with a modeler I could afford -- i.e., a free one. So I did my own from scratch with the Persistence of Vision ray tracer.

I haven't put in any textures yet... but I think it came out rather well for an hour's work.

Edit: Finished the model. Not perfect... close....

For Povray modelers, here's the scene file for the final cube:
