# I feel your pain.

World of Warcraft is a name of power. It summons spam blogscrapers from the mist-filled depths where they lurk, waiting for someone of the mortal world to summon them forth. World of Warcraft. Their noses twitch, their ghastly bone spines quiver, the hunt begins.

I feel most sorry for the WoW bloggers who have to deal with them every hour of every day.
