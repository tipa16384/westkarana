# How to start an EverQuest blog.

1) Be an EverQuest player of any level, experience, anything. This is the tough step.

2) There is no step 2.

3) Go to WordPress.com or Blogger.com and make a blog. It's free. Hardest part is coming up with a name. I just went through EverQuest zones until I found one that wasn't taken. I wanted Freeport or Qeynos :)

4) Every couple of days, post about what you're doing in the game. Just posting something like "We checked out Oceangreen Hills today. Now I can't decide if I hate bears or zombies more." is enough. That's it. "Whole guild was down in the new Kaesora xping. Great drops. XP, not so much." You don't need to write a book or include a million pictures -- unless you want to :)

5) After a couple of weeks, post comments or send email to every MMO blog you read asking them to link to your site.

This works for Asheron's Call and Dark Age of Camelot, too. And Saga of Ryzom and -- and for any game that is still a lot of fun but doesn't get a lot of coverage. People WANT to read about what you're doing!
