# Wizard 101: Take THIS, Thomas!

Thomas Lionblood has been having a [bunch of fun](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2009/01/tres-de-smarmy.html), [bringing magical artifacts](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2009/01/smarmy-part-duex.html) [infused with Death power](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2009/01/terminus.html) to the verdant green of the Life school.

We Life wizards will no longer put up with this blatant disregard for the power of Life.

So here I am with my new Life staff standing in front of, oh my, is this the Death school?

I get a HUGE bonus, fighting against Death users. HUGE. MASSIVE.

Come on out to play, Thomas dear, won't you?

Half a bubble from level 48. Ballpark guess, I think I'm about halfway through Dragonspyre, based on the number of books I have found.

**Aimor** writes: Great Blog. Always has been. I've been reading since about 2007. I've really liked your coverage on EQ2 of course, but I'm finally going to try that quirky Wizard 101 game you always cover. Maybe it's a game my wife will finally try. Thanks Tipa!

**Saylah** writes: *cackles* more converts.  W101 is a great family game.  I don't get to play with Tipa much because she's way ahead of me but I love reading where she is and knowing what awaits me.  I'm probably 50% through Mooshu and in no particular hurry.  DS just came out so I'm not expecting them to release another zone any time soon.  I'm taking my time.  I don't think I'm going to take the time to farm anything until I hit DS.  Doesn't seem to make sense at this point.  \r\n\r\nGreat staff!  I wish Balance had a real school in Ravenwood.  Death players probably wish that too.  I feel left out not having the towers to meet up with your like spec'd school mates. *sheds a tear*
