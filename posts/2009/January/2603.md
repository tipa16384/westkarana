"this Irish Republican Army this illa solvet saeclum in favilla test David cum sybilla" ????? Then again it probably isn't German and Babel fish doesn't have a Latin option. 

I think that it was actually some kind of witchcraft to resurrect Scotty from the dead. Am I right?


Great cartoon by the way Tipa - hope you do more.

will dissolve the world into burning coals,
as David bore witness with the Sibyll.

How great a tremor is to be,
when the judge is to come
briskly shattering every grave.

etc... :)

Neither Car nor Hat knew what it meant, they were words Scottie had asked him to say.

It's awesome when Monopoly pieces come this well-prepared for their violent deaths.

Anyway. whenever we'd visit the Pineos, we had to go to the Roman Catholic church on Sunday's. They did High Mass even though the Pope had already gave permission for the liturgy to be said in English, so my main memories of being a kid in a Catholic church was sitting around, unable to understand even one word of what was going on, watching other people for cues to kneel and silently saying the Lord's Prayer the RIGHT way instead of the Catholic way...

Singing the hymns was always my favorite part of the Protestant service. The RC church I went to didn't even have that.

I was a child of the 1960's. I grew up very much under the influence of Vatican 2. It was all folk masses, hippy priests and a supposedly vernacular version of the Gospel which combined American English and ancient Hebrew in equal measure. Its all fairly embarrassing looking back but then again I guess the past always is.

Gruss Gott!

After I finished this comic, I knew what the next comic would have to be about. So this isn't the end of this particular arc, but it might be a week or two before it appears. It's gotten kinda far from just being about the MMO, Darkfall, though.
