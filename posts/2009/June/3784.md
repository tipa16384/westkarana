# Wizard 101: Grizzleheim goes live July 1!

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-06-30 20:14:45*

Grizzleheim, the Bazaar, crafting, groups, open chat, and newly enhanced boss mobs comes to Wizard 101 July 1st, after an extended downtime.


> Wizard101 will undergo an extended maintenance window on 01 July 2009 from 3am to approximately 5am Central US time. This downtime may extend beyond two hours and we will message accordingly.

Wizard101 is going offline to add Grizzleheim, Crafting, Bazaar and Enhanced Chat features to the game. For more information on what is being added to Wizard101 at this time, please see our [Update Notes](https://www.wizard101.com/site/home2/wizard101/menu_8ad6a4042143509a01214f16a86b00cf).
