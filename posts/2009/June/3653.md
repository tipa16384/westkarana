# Daily Blogroll becoming Nightly Blogroll

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-06-08 08:02:02*

Morning is not the best time to be doing the blogroll -- work and everything. So I will be writing them when I get home, which might make them a little more timely as well.

Expect the first tonight, but as an extra -- [the next two comics in Straha's epic EverQuest comic, WTF, are up](http://www.wtfcomics.com/archive.html?346_345)! Straha's daughter Kaitis tries to stop Venril Sathir from wiping out her family, but is there anyone that can stop Kaitis?
