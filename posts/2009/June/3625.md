Like I need an excuse to show off my home :) And though I love my little Marleybone manor, it doesn't even come close to comparing with the marvelous work others have done on their homes. Every time I visit one, I feel like spending hours just peeking in room after room.

Molly asked if I could list the prices on all the homes, and that was easy enough, so here they are:





| World | Land & Castle Name | Cost in Gold | Description |


| Wizard City | Wooded Cottage | 8000 | small castle |

|  | Forested Mansion | 15000 | larger castle with an outdoor theater |

|  |


| Krokotopia | Oasis Camp | 10000 | a large tent |

|  | Desert Villa | 20000 | some larger buildings and a dramatic cliff |

|  |


| Marleybone | Metropolitan Manor | 12000 | a short bit of street, a park, a cellar and a split-level brownstone -- this is what I have. |

|  | Royal Estate | 30000 | a large home set atop a mill with several parks and a semi-enclosed greenhouse/arboreum |

|  |


| Mooshu | Tranquil Cottage | 15000 | a decent-sized Japanese-themed home |

|  | Imperial Palace | 40000 | you could get lost in this. a dramatic castle fit for a warlord. |

|  |


| Dragonspyre | Great Citadel | 20000 | small tower |

|  | Grand Fortress | 50000 | HUGE tower with many extra secrets |

|  |




[The June issue of the Ravenwood Newsletter is out](https://www.wizard101.com/site/home2/wizard101/page_8ad6a40421866c5001219ce593a45757), talking again about Grizzleheim, and also introducing a limited-time offer -- $60 for a whole year of complete access to everything in Wizard 101. That's $5/month, and that's a tremendous bargain for one of the most original MMOs to come around in years.

Grizzleheim should be on the Wizard 101 test server soon, and I'll be writing lots about it as soon as I get in.
