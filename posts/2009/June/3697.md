[IGN has the scoop on Wizard 101's next expansion, Grizzleheim](http://pc.ign.com/articles/995/995096p1.html). The article goes into a little detail about the three main clans of Grizzleheim, the war-like Bears, the cunning Wolves and the mystical Ravens. And as a tidbit, at the very end, [it looks like Thomas was right on the money](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2009/06/will-grizzleheim-be-released-on-test.html), as the article mentions that Grizzleheim goes live on Test today.

So I either think that: A:IGN was lying, B:There is still a bug that they neeed to fix, or C:They are going to release it later today. IDK those are just my choices but its about 8:50 and still no subcriber ribbon on any page.

**Ryan Winterstone** writes: I think it's C - it will be released later today because one, i don't think IGN would lie, and two, the people at KI were writing the music and fixing the bugs (the last things they had to do) LAST week, so we were all predicting it would come out this week, so i think it makes perfect sense to come out today. And also, all of the latest things that they have added - housing and dragonsyre have been released very late at night, so I would predict it will come out tonight at about 10 or 11 (EST, that's when they came out where I live, on the east coast)

**Ginny** writes: I checked and it is not on yet. I wish it was because its free to go to and my subscription ended a few weeks ago so I can't go anywhere except the stupid Wizard city.
