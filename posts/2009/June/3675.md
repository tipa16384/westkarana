I have JUST heard from a very reliable source that EverQuest II's next expansion will be on the frozen continent of Velious.

This was EverQuest's second expansion, and for the first time brought a three faction war into the game, where players chose sides and earned rewards. Also appearing was Sleeper's Tomb, which included the once-per-server event where players woke The Sleeper, the illicit child of forbidden dragon love, who was imprisoned lest he destroy the world.

So, waking him would be a bad thing.

More as I hear more.

Note to self: Start getting on SOE tours again.....
