This will go down in history as the day when Scottie Dog defeated Captain Jack Sparrow.

In My Brute, anyway. (PS -- click here to roll up a Brute and [become one of A Dire Bear's pupils](http://a-dire-bear.mybrute.com)).

Finally got to level 10 with A Dire Bear, btw, and made a new clan, [Clan Nostalgia the Clan](http://mybrute.com/team/47928). So that's ANOTHER game we're in :)
