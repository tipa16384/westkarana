# PS3: Limited edition free "Home" Chamber apartment

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-05-15 13:00:57*

SCEA wants all you PS3 owners who tried their "Home" virtual lobby once and then never tried it again that if you log in from May 14-21, you can get a new, limited edition, never to be offered again, Chamber apartment with trees, waterfalls, and skeeters.

Well, maybe not the skeeters.

I remember being really excited about Home but it took so long to come out that I was bored of the concept before I even tried it. Then I logged on once, got insulted by the first person I met and realised that it wasn't going to be a very interesting place to hang around in :)
