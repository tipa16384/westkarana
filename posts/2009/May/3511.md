# PS3: Limited edition free "Home" Chamber apartment

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-05-15 13:00:57*

SCEA wants all you PS3 owners who tried their "Home" virtual lobby once and then never tried it again that if you log in from May 14-21, you can get a new, limited edition, never to be offered again, Chamber apartment with trees, waterfalls, and skeeters.

Well, maybe not the skeeters.
