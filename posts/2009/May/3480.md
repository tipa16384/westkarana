# Daily Blogroll 5/11 -- Reboot edition

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-05-11 07:18:38*

I saw *Star Trek* Friday night -- and it was great. Kinda made me wonder if someone could do the same for *Star Wars*... like if, somehow, Jarjar Binks went back in time to train Anakin before Qui-gon Schindler got to him...

After an exciting Free Realms weekend in which the log-in servers were down for many hours, I still got some time in. Restarted as an archer and got to level 7, right in the middle of the grind to level 10. Tobold got his blacksmith to 20 and finds the whole job pointless since fairly cheap RMT weapons you can get at level 1 are way better than [the best weapons you can craft at 20](http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2009/05/free-realms-combat.html). 

Peter at Dragonchasers writes about the difficulties and strategies in [doing a Free Realms instance in a group](http://dragonchasers.com/2009/05/10/a-rough-free-realms-weekend/). Groups are rare in Free Realms; the one pickup group I was in was a total disaster because nobody knows how to handle it, but they go alright with people you know.

Spinks at Spinksville writes about [all the various jobs in Free Realms](http://spinksville.wordpress.com/2009/05/10/getting-to-know-free-realms/), collections, what your five bucks for a membership gets you, and the awesomeness of having friends. 

Cuppy of Cuppytalk agrees that friends are awesome -- [if you can get them onto your friends list](http://www.cuppycake.org/?p=746) in her constructive criticism of Free Realms. There's easily a dozen people I would love to have on my friends list, but it's been impossible to arrange times to meet.

Crookshankz at the Gaming Goob wonders what tortured path led from he and his wife reminiscing about EverQuest [to both of them playing it again](http://thegaminggoob.wordpress.com/2009/05/10/eq-how-did-i-get-here/). I wonder if they're going to be restarting on the new 51/50 server....

Stargrace and her posse return to EverQuest as well to take on the last of the Fableds and [explore the dark temple to the demigod of shadow, Vex Thal](http://mmoquests.com/2009/05/10/thuuga-quests-cazic-thul-vex-thal-and-innoruuk/). So, so many good times there. I remember that time we were killing blobs and I went AFK... for half an hour... auto-stabbing away until a stray gravity flux exposed my AFK-ness. Them were the days.

Vaarsuvius is [getting her butt kicked](http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0652.html) in Order of the Stick, but Roy is still not resurrected, so feel free to skip this one, too. Gonna have to start holding "Save Roy" vigils.

Via Massively, [the latest chapter of the EVE Online machinema, Clear Skies, has been released](http://www.massively.com/2009/05/10/clear-skies-2-has-been-released/). I absolutely loved the first one and can't wait to see this one. It's an in-game movie using EVE Online for the space battles and a heavily modded Half Life 2 for the character acting.

Jennifer of Girl, Unplugged, writes at length about [the completely predictable over-reaction](http://girlunplugged.wordpress.com/2009/05/10/the-decline-of-farmerman/) by Paragon Studios to their Architect missions being used for farming purposes. Jennifer notes that since the introduction of Architect, it's been next to impossible to find missions doing anything else. Has putting level design tools in player hands ruined City of Heroes?

Hudson at Hudson's Hideout writes about Saga of Ryzom's [return from F2P reboot hell](http://hudshideout.com/blog/?p=2374) to paid Triple AAA Sandbox MMO space. Ryzom was one of the first MMOs to allow player-made content, and seems to have avoided the pitfalls City of Heroes fell in to. Ryzom has always been on my "would love to try" list, but that's never actually led to me actually installing the game...

Heartless of Heartless\_ Gamer didn't like the direction Mythos was going when Flagship imploded, and [wonders what Hanbit is doing to finish it](http://hgamer.blogspot.com/2009/05/mythos-two-studios-one-new-beginning.html). I don't often agree with Heartless, but he's spot-on here. The Overworld addition that would turn Mythos' heavy instancing into a more normal MMO world wasn't working for me. I LIKED the quick trips to dungeons -- but then, I did like the city redesigns, too.

Suzina of Kill Ten Rats warns that [your MMO is turning into WoW](http://www.killtenrats.com/2009/05/09/niche-mmos/). Every new addition is meant to bring it closer to that Holy Grail of being WoW. I link here only to note that a game currently in closed beta takes the whole concept of a superhero MMO as implemented by Paragon Studios, and supplies the answer to the question, "What if City of Heroes was more like WoW?"

Look, devs, WoW players are happy playing WoW. Your game will never be enough like WoW to outdo WoW being like WoW. You won't publish your miracle "more like WoW" patch and get ten million players. Not gonna happen, EVER.

Potshot dives into the intricacies of [setting up a secret base in EVE Online's "w-space"](http://potshot.wordpress.com/2009/05/08/the-expedition/), the mysterious reaches at the far end of a wormhole that could collapse at any moment. Even if you have zero interest in EVE, you'll want to read this amazing account of setting up a long term exploration into the most unknown of territories.

Syp at Bio Break wonders how Bioware [can make other classes enticing enough](http://biobreak.wordpress.com/2009/05/08/star-wars-super-troopers/) in Star Wars: The Old Republic to stop everyone from making Jedis the SW:TOR Death Knights. In Bioware's latest update, the Trooper class tries to make tanking sexy for the Republic.

And lastly, Gianna of "The Noob Comic" [encounters an infamous reviewer](http://www.thenoobcomic.com/index.php?pos=350).

Hey, for this week, can we NOT mention Eurogamer?

Just saying :)

I should really do the Blogroll on weekends.... this is getting way too long!
