# EVE Online breaking news: CVA dissolved

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-10-28 18:20:17*

The mega-EVE alliance Curatores Veritatis Alliance (CVA), one of the alliances that keep the nullsec Providence region mostly safe and pirate free, was dissolved today. [CVA leaders are calling it an account hacking](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1205265) and have vowed to either get CCP to roll the hack back or to form a new alliance from the ashes of the old.

Reaction from the community has been mixed, [with many glad to see the end of the alliance](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1205168) that more than any other, set the tone for Providence and unabashedly claimed it for the Amarr empire, sworn enemies of my own character's Gallente Federation.

We've had our own run-ins with CVA, but I can't claim to know them well enough to be sad or happy at their disbanding, but I will admit our corp has enjoyed the relative safety of Providence during their reign.

Update: Looks like CCP may restore CVA? If them, then why not BoB?

**JeffN** writes: There are ways to win games. This is not one of them. As more details surface, this will become more clear. Still, what *is* clear is that the security for the Allaince structure is flawed. CCP knew this when BOB was felled by a disgruntled director. CVA is a long-standing ally of my Corporation, but I do not care if this happened to Star Fraction or Ushra'Khan (two of our biggest enemies), I would still be angry and feel sorry for those effected.\r\n\r\nLook, it takes 10 hours to delete a character in EVE, nearly a week for the standings of a new corporation to update. There is a precedence of delays and failsafes in EVE. BOB should have been the last Alliance to suffer from this even though they shouldn't have suffered it at all!\r\n\r\nHacked accounts usually means lost money and items, but disbanding an entire Alliance, especially ones as big as BOB or CVA have repercussions that cannot simply be rolled back, not to mention the loss of trust and faith and desire to continue by victimized players who took a real life hit in the chops.\r\n\r\nThis isn't Pong. We just don't hit reset. Players in EVE can accumulate vast amounst of wealth in-game which equates to significant effort, planning, and an investement of real life cash not to mention the TIME. To those who might dismiss this as "just a computer game"...it's not. Drop a bowling ball on the hood of an antique car that someone has taken the time and effort to restore and tell them "it's just a car". And, last time I checked, the Mona Lisa had a pane of bullet-proof glass over it, even though it's just a picture.\r\n\r\nCCP had best learn from this and learn fast. Otherwise there won't be anyone who cares about DUST knowing that all their effort in space and on the ground can be undone with a simple act of vandalism.

**mbp** writes: The impression I get is that a single rogue official can bring down a whole alliance with a few screen clicks. If that is the case it does sound excessively risky. Perhaps there could be some kind of controls put in place - i.e. it needs the consent of 50% of the directors to dissolve an alliance or some such. Pardon my own ignorance if this is already the case. \r\n\r\nI am all for high level board room intrigue in EVE and I love reading about corporate raids but it shouldn't be ridiculously easy to do.

**Wiqd** writes: The thing about BoB though is that I thought the person who dissolved it was part of an espionage plot from Goonfleet to do so. This is just blatant hacking and dissolving. BoB's situation was very much politics (as it took a number of years for the person to gain the trust and rights to do what he did). I approve of the BoB one, not so much this one.

**Callan S.** writes: If there was a game where hacking was an allowed part of gameplay, then that's within the rules.\r\n\r\nHere it isn't. I don't know why there's confusion about something within the rules (espionage) and something outside the rules (hacking) and why something that's outside the rules gets rolled back, while something within the rules remains as is.
