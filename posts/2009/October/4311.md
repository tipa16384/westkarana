# Wizard101: Wizard City Confidential

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-10-07 18:02:58*

Where once crowds of new characters would beg for treasure cards, now the beggars have entirely new things for which to beg. All of these are based on actual things heard within the space of a few minutes in Wizard City Commons on the Test server.

(my apologies to the various AFK people who got their pictures snapped by me)
