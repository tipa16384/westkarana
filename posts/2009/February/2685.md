# Bringing Balance to Wizard 101

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-02-17 07:47:13*

Agh, I have SO MUCH STUFF TO TALK ABOUT! I won't even get a chance to write about EQ2 today :/

Cool outfit, isn't it? Total trash, aside from the boots which are a marginal upgrade from the Crowns boots I was wearing. The danger of dressing to kill is that it isn't actually that much use in the actual killing. I was being torn apart by Forum mobs before I realized I did not have my fighting clothes on. OOPS.

Busy, busy, busy weekend in Wizard 101. I was totally unable to continue in the main plot for Dragonspyre as a key element in the progression, defeating Orin Grimcaster in the Fleshless Tower, became impossible for me. Not because he's so difficult, but because I just can't get into the tower. Lots of people are having the same problem and simply cannot get in, though some report that they can. Not sure why, but it meant that I couldn't come closer to meeting Malistaire on my own terms.

I did run around and do some side quests in Crystal Grove and the Forum, but there's just so much to do... and a lot of these fights are just really, really tedious for a Life wizard all on her own and all alone.

So, I reactivated my second account, signed her up for another month, and spent several hours leveling her from 21 to 25. Alison (named after my daughter, of course!) is a Balance/Death wizard, and between her Sandstorm AE and my Meteor and Blizzard AEs, there wasn't a lot in Krokotopia that could stand more than a round or two against us. Back when I'd been farming Marleybone instances with her for pets, she'd gotten a lot of rare level 25 gear, so that was the goal for the day.

When she dinged 25, off we went back to Dragonspyre, where the super high level wandering mobs in the Forum suddenly became a lot more possible. See, you don't always have to be the same level as everyone else to help out. Anyone can help, even in the very highest instances. A level 25 in a zone meant for people near 50? You bet.

She'll be put back in the box after Dragonspyre, but until then, she gives me the extra oomph I need.

[Thomas](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/) and I had another go at Malistaire Friday night. It was fun, but would have been funner if either Kyle or I had gotten our robes from the guy. He's gonna die again and again until he coughs them up, so he should get with the program, call his tailor, and have them nicely boxed and gift-wrapped next time we see him.

I spent a couple of hours trying to get Lord Nightshade to drop the winged robe for me, but no luck. I did get a couple of Valentine's wands and a pet, so it wasn't a total loss. Here, then, is the latest fashion show, with new pets and wands.
