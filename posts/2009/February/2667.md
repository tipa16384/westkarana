# Wizard 101: World beyond Dragonspyre due out in summer

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-02-11 07:36:11*

> As you adventure through Dragonpsyre, you will be able to complete quests and receive amazing new items. Once you reach level 50, you will not be able to gain more experience. However, you will be able to advance beyond level 50 when we move into the summer semester at Ravenwood.



My guess? A bird world, which would be home to the relatives of Gamma and Mr. Lincoln. Perhaps in the branches of a giant, giant tree.... We'll find out this summer if we'll be moving into Grizzleheim or Celestia next.

What I really want to know is, how do they use their wings and fly with all those robes and hats? Wouldn't the drag be a deal killer?

I do hope that whichever the next world is, they make the fights less tedious. As the health of the mobs spiral, our damage really hasn't. I got my last damage spell, the centaur, way back midway through Marleybone. When the level 48 spells are released, mine will be a group-wide heal and absorb shield, which is nice, but won't help me solo at all.

There's a great thread about [the possible sixth world, Celestia](http://www.wizard101central.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5255), over at [Wizard 101 Central](http://www.wizard101central.com/).

I know, haven't finished Dragonspyre (on my own) yet, and already looking forward to the next world. come on, appearance slots and player owned and decorated islands!

W101 doesn't have much re-play value to me at least. It's the same exact quests happening in the same exact order for the most part. Also the quests chains aren't trivial. Starting from level 1 isn't something I'd be looking to do. I guess continuing to pump out content is the answer they've chosen which is great.

I'd love to have what you've mentioned plus a resetting of the non primary skills (talent points). Being absolutely stuck with decisions you started making day one when you barely knew the game bites. Of all those things appearance slots and player housing would excite me the most.

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: Yes, I'd really like to see them reset talent points as well. I'm thinking Life/Balance would be way more useful in the end game than Life/Fire. I almost never bother with Fire now except to load up Meteor when I remember it. I would love to start up a Myth wizard like the one I played in Beta, but the thought of doing all these worlds all over again... nah. Can't do it.

So I made a new guy, same last name- Lucas Lotusdreamer , I made him Balance / Life after reading a bunch of your posts. Hopefully that works out in the end. It's starting to feel like I'm just outlasting the enemies. I'm still learning though. Already it seems a lot harder than the average MMO, i never played a trading card game before so it's a lot of fun having to think more.
Now if i can only figure out how to find people. I'm usually on Bernie I think.

**yunk** writes: hey this is old but .. i just finished my first instance the Sunken City, with some guy that needed it. I took my lvl 13 balance / life wizard and it rocked. It was getting annoying soloing but once I saw him in action in a group against bosses it was awesome. I just shielded and healed and debuffed the enemies and buffed the damage of the other guy and sometimes did damage but it was a lot of fun finally. That build is really a group build. 

I imagine it also is one that could annoy the heck of out anyone I duel in pvp. :) But so far I can't seem to join any battles even the practice ones, it always says i am the wrong level. I'm just using access pass now.

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: Ah, I can tell you read the secret news from Lydia on Thomas the Friendly Necromancer's blog! Well, we don't know the Candy World *isn't* Celestia or Grizzleheim, so maybe we'll be there sooner than we thing :)

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: You don't need to go to Dragonspyre to go to Grizzleheim. Grizzleheim is meant to be a separate adventure.

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: The waiting is the hard part! But we'll have the pet races to keep us busy before then
