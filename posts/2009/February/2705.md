I was just sitting around, waiting for a spot on the Trakanon raid to open, and I got to thinking, hmm... I should write that Twitter-based RPG I've been talking about.

So last night and this morning, that's what I did. Players can enter the game and whack on a mob until one of them dies.

Doesn't sound like a lot of fun, and it isn't, but right now, it's all about getting the basics done, get something working -- anything, really -- as quickly as possible, so I can see how to move things forward. All about the iterative game programming style, right? Make it fun, then add new stuff, make it fun some more, etc.

And re: the code snip above -- no, I am not planning on making every mob and weapon an individual class. This is just getting things going quickly.

You can follow progress on Twitter by searching on #bearraid, or following @direbear. Beware of occasional spam, though I will be working on the game offline for awhile now that I know the basic Twitter connection is working.

Yes, Bear is taking on the additional duties of emceeing this game in the downtime of his Adventures in Monopoly gig.
