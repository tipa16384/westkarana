I'd love to talk about Spellborn. I've been a big fan of it for a couple years now, wrote about it at every opportunity at Massively, even had the collector's box set shipped from Germany and leveled up chars on the EU servers because I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME. Cue creepy "[I'm your number one fan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5xehYVnsnY)" music...

So when I heard Acclaim was going to have a chat about the NA version of Spellborn, part of me went YAY! Then I found out it was going to be at noon (PST). On a weekday. When I, and probably most likely players, would be at work. So. Bah. Epic fail.

I just want to play!

Acclaim's announcement after the break. Complaints about the time can be brought to Acclaim's "Acclaim Sucks?" room. (Oh, yes. Acclaim Community Manager 'Historian' saith: "Was inspired by user ret2121 who created 2 rooms 'acclaim sucks' and 'Acclaim Sucks!!'. Seemed like a good way to get feedback.")
