# Out of work? Home sick? Wanna talk about Spellborn?

**Breaking news! Acclaim CEO Howard Marks says Chronicles of Spellborn closed beta starts NEXT WEEK!**
======================================================================================================



[![sb_client-2009-02-26-19-48-24-71](../../../uploads/2009/02/sb_client-2009-02-26-19-48-24-71.jpg "sb_client-2009-02-26-19-48-24-71")](../../../uploads/2009/02/sb_client-2009-02-26-19-48-24-71.jpg)

I'd love to talk about Spellborn. I've been a big fan of it for a couple years now, wrote about it at every opportunity at Massively, even had the collector's box set shipped from Germany and leveled up chars on the EU servers because I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME. Cue creepy "[I'm your number one fan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5xehYVnsnY)" music...

So when I heard Acclaim was going to have a chat about the NA version of Spellborn, part of me went YAY! Then I found out it was going to be at noon (PST). On a weekday. When I, and probably most likely players, would be at work. So. Bah. Epic fail.

I just want to play!

Acclaim's announcement after the break. Complaints about the time can be brought to Acclaim's "Acclaim Sucks?" room. (Oh, yes. Acclaim Community Manager 'Historian' saith: "Was inspired by user ret2121 who created 2 rooms 'acclaim sucks' and 'Acclaim Sucks!!'. Seemed like a good way to get feedback.")


Hi, We’re going to have our first Spellborn Community Chat on Friday Feb 27th, at Noon (Pacific time).

David Perry the USA Game Director, and El Dryver, the Lead Game Designer will be on the call.

This chat will be held on Voon, http://voon.vivox.com in the “Acclaim Spellborn” Room.

I expected the game to be out by now. OTOH, I guess it's better they launch it solid then have a Darkfall debacle. :)

**Rob** writes: I was thinking about spellborn the other day. So, having played the game a bit, what do you think? Are you still as excited about it as you were prior to playing it?
---
**Tipa** writes: Yes; it's a very unique setting and the combat is -- improvisational. You jump around to dodge attacks all while setting up your own attacks, which are usually strung together in combos that build upon one another to be truly devastating. And have I mentioned how much I like the setting?

My only real disappointment with Spellborn so far is how few people are playing it. I'm hoping that we in North America can give a better showing.

**Sente** writes: The reason for the time is probably because El Drijver, lead game designer is going to participate also. Since he is in CET time zone most likely I guess they wanted to schedule a time before he gets to bed, since it will start at 9pm CET.
But it does really suck as for time for you in the US. Even the kids should be at school by that time.

It would probably have been better to set it up in the weekend.

**Tipa** writes: Yeah, writing an article on it right now actually :)

**Openedge1** writes: All I can say is..."About time?"

I mean...sheesh...the first Vaporware launch game in history (game had launched, but looked like it would never launch...make sense?)

Cheers

**Sente** writes: Edge, yes makes sense :)

The release over here was in my mind a "limited availability" release - only available to a few select customers where major issues and bugs are addressed that they could not catch in beta. My employer has done some of those for a few major software revisions.

The real release will happen later, when Acclaim will go live and my guess also some revised market split management between the publishers to actually allow people to play together, even in Europe.

**Tipa** writes: Sounds like good questions for the Spellborn conference call... are you planning on attending?

**Saylah** writes: I don't know, a couple of years ago I was going to leave WOW for this game but then it went all vapor on me. At this point, I'm not willing to invest a box price until a couple of months at least after it releases to NA. If other players feel a bit put-off by how this has unfolded, you may not have the NA presence you're hoping for.
---
**Openedge1** writes: Don't forget, you get to try it free first Saylah. So, just see if it works, and if not, no need to buy it...

Cool!
---
**Sente** writes: Saylah, no need to buy a box. 
As Edge says, you can try it to level 7 for free. And if Acclaim does it the same way they did here in Europe, you will only have to pay the subscription fee if you go for the full game.
