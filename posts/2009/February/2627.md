# Giving Monopoly the respect it deserves

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-02-07 07:21:48*

Undoubtedly due to the recent upturn in Monopoly fandom due to Adventures in Monopoly, none other than Ridley Scott of "Black Rain" and "Legends" fame is [planning on directing a big-screen adaptation of "Monopoly"](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=13479). He has not yet contacted me on how I could work with him to write a mind-blowing Monopoly script, but I will keep you all up to date.
