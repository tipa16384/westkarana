So I thought I would have some dynamic pictures of PvPing but -- turns out I didn't actually TAKE any, so that's out. Instead, I guess I'll just have to show off my two wizard's spring outfits.

Because, if I dress them in Spring colors, Spring will come sooner, right?

The idea, when dyeing outfits, is two fold: First, make it obvious what their school is. You should be proud of your school of magic! I admit, in PvP, it took me a couple of rounds to figure out that I was facing TWO Life wizards, because only one of them was wearing the green.

I don't like that you don't know anything about your opponents in PvP. But I guess that's part of the fun.

The second plan for dyeing, and this is just a rule I adopted for myself, is that no two pieces could have the same two colors.

Allison -- she's the balance wizard -- was a tough nut. Balance school colors are ORANGE and PINK. There is NO WAY you can make something nice from that. Sigh. Okay. I mixed some gold in, but there's your orange and pink. Yuk.

Anyway. I have articles on PvP and deck building coming up. The PvP article will take awhile because I want to figure out some strats and -- well, I'm not going to come here and write about winning in PvP until I am winning more duels than I lose. I will say that the strats for 1v1, 2v2 and 4v4 are entirely different, and so the type of duel you prefer will absolutely change the cards you bring to the game.

That said, I'll probably write my article on deck building, especially "short" decks, sometime this week. Look for it, and see you around Ravenwood!
