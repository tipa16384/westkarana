# Adventures in Monopoly: Revenge, Part 2

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-02-08 00:59:45*

All this next week will be back to regular adventures in regular MMOs. This comic just forced itself to be written, so what could I do? I'm weak, I admit it.

Poem is in many ways similar to Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner". The font used is RPG Script and was donated for general use by [Bad Gods](http://badgods.com/)' Lore Sj√∂berg, so for those people who wonder what you can get out of Twitter, hey, the occasional free font.

Look at our new comic about budgeting based on Monopoly."

What are the odds!\r\n\r\nNice catch :) I could only wish that they'd actually gotten it from me, though :) Probably just a case of coincidence. Still, if they have a vampire Scottie dog or, heavens, BEAR in there... well, we'll have to have a chat.
