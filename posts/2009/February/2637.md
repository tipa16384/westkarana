# Adventures in Monopoly: Revenge, Part 2

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-02-08 00:59:45*

All this next week will be back to regular adventures in regular MMOs. This comic just forced itself to be written, so what could I do? I'm weak, I admit it.

Poem is in many ways similar to Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner". The font used is RPG Script and was donated for general use by [Bad Gods](http://badgods.com/)' Lore Sj√∂berg, so for those people who wonder what you can get out of Twitter, hey, the occasional free font.
