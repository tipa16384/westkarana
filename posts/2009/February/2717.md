# Sick Sixth Six!

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-02-23 18:44:46*

Okay, Stargrace [tagged me with a meme](http://mmoquests.com/2009/02/23/sixth-screenshot-meme/) to post the sixth screenshot from the sixth subfolder of my saved screenshots.

So that's what I'm gonna do. All my file names are actually a hash code I made so I wouldn't keep duplicate pictures so honestly, I don't know what picture is gonna show here.

This is from my EQ Classic folder, and shows us in a Hate raid, before it was made into an xp zone.

That's Bridgecrusher tanking, so this is either with United Norrath Coalition or A Twist of Fate, most likely UNC. I don't see any recognizable planar armor, but I do see Kunark armor, so that would probably make this screen shot from sometime in mid-late 2000.

I'm not going to tag anyone, but if anyone else wants to go through their screen shots -- sixth screen in sixth subfolder -- feel free, and link back :)

For Quain -- I loved the old UI!!!

Heh :)

Oh yeah, check out the awesome Sol B armor.
