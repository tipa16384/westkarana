# Music for a Meltdown

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-02-05 08:32:35*

Some of you may know about the HUGE turmoil in my personal life that happened yesterday, and if you don't, well, be thankful :)

Upshot is, I didn't finish the comic I was doing. BUT! I come bearing tunes instead!

While recording my story for Saylah's [Game Fiction Podcast](http://notadiary.typepad.com/gamersfictionpodcast/), I ended up with my Rock Band microphone hooked up to my computer, and Audacity, a multi-track freeware audio recording program running on same, and got to thinking. You know what would be cool? To play all five parts of a Renaissance recorder ensemble piece, just for fun.

[You can hear that here](http://files.filefront.com/betterballetmp3/;13208213;/fileinfo.html), but that isn't the best part.

I mentioned I'd done this to a friend, [Thomas, the Friendly Necromancer](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/), and he suggested I send it to him, and he'd do a techno remix.

Techno remix of a Renaissance piece? That would sound... weird. It would sound something [very much like this](http://files.filefront.com/wicked+recorder+goof+offmp3/;13208242;/fileinfo.html)! Totally awesome, way better than the original piece!

Just been so, so long since I was in a band and actually had to sound decent and play well with others. Listening to what I recorded just shows how long it has been since I cared. Work to do!

When it does treat yourself to a hot bath with sweet smelling oils, a glass of wine to sip on and sushi (or your favorite comfort food ). That's what I do. Well that and tell everyone to leave me the hell alone! :-) Hope things get better for ya.
