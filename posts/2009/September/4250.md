# Earth Eternal: Closed Beta stress test this afternoon!

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-09-26 12:24:13*

![Cool hat!](../../../uploads/2009/09/eehat.jpg "Cool hat!") [Earth Eternal](http://www.eartheternal.com/) is having a little stress test for their servers before they leap from closed to open beta. If you're lucky enough to be in the closed beta for this rats, cats and rabbits game, and are logged in at 2PM Pacific Time, 5PM Eastern Time, or whatever time that is where you live, [you're gonna get this samurai-esque helmet](http://www.eartheternal.com/team_blog/ee-stress-test-saturday-2pm-pdt) to wear into open beta. I don't know if it will carry over to the live game or not.

Pretty snazzy hat. In Earth Eternal, you can (similarly to Runes of Magic and Chronicles of Spellborn) [combine the appearance of one item with the stats of another](http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/74270) to give you real flexibility in how you want to look. 

If you're NOT in the closed beta, [Massively has a thousand beta keys to hand out](http://www.massively.com/2009/09/25/stress-test-earth-eternal-get-a-cool-hat/), so whatcha waiting for?

I bet a lot more people would slog through gathering all those diamonds and black pearls for that, I know I would just so I could see my hair again.
