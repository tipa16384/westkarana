# Wizard101: A Video Tour of the New School Houses

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-12-04 18:11:35*

Just what it says on the tin. A video of me running through the seven new school-specific houses. Enjoy :) (Looks best in HD).

The winged Guardian robed I'm wearing there come from the Crowns store. Almost everyone bought some with the free Test-realm Crowns. I met a wizard in one of the homes who had a similar winged outfit, but it was subtly different. I checked out her character, and she had the real deal -- the high-end dueling robes you get only by winning many, many duels. I felt kinda sorry for her. When this expansion goes live, very few people will be able to appreciate her accomplishment.
