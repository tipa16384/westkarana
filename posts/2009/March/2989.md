# XFire Wordpress Plugin -- first release

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-03-26 23:53:14*

Announcing the [XFire Stats Wordpress Plugin](../../../uploads/2009/03/xfirestats.zip). This plugin adds a widget that you can place on the sidebar of your Wordpress blog to show your gaming stats for the past week -- the title and time spent, sorted by decreasing time.

This is the very first release of this, my very first plugin, and feedback is definitely encouraged.

To install:
1. Right click on [this link](../../../uploads/2009/03/xfirestats.zip) and choose "Save Link As..." and name it 'xfirestats.zip'.

3. Unzip this file to find 'xfirestats.php'

5. Upload 'xfirestats.php' to the plugins folder of your Wordpress installation -- http://*yourblog.com*/wp-content/plugins/ might be the spot, but there will definitely be other plugins there. Automatic installation is coming.
- Go to your Wordpress dashboard. Choose Plugins, and activate XFire Stats.

- In your dashboard, choose Appearance and then Widgets.

- Drag the XFire Stats widget where you want it to go.

- Edit it, and entire your XFire Id and, optionally, a title for the widget (otherwise the title will be XFire Weekly Stats).

- Save changes.

- See that it appears correctly in your blog.




Enjoy! Please send me an email at brendahol@gmail.com if you have any trouble, reactions, suggestions, untapped rage, etc.

The most recent version of this plugin will always be at the "XFire Plugin" page linked in the header to this blog.

**Necrotherian** writes: I dunno. Seems a bit too "Big Brother"-y for my tastes. 8D

Seriously, though, I might try it out this weekend. Thanks in advance. :)

Well, nobody has to use it if they don't want to!

**Tipa** writes: Next feature, based on a suggestion: an optional line with your XFire handle linking to your personal page, and a status -- either offline, online, or the game you are currently playing.

It will be, by default, disabled.

**Stargrace** writes: Ohh I like the future feature! I keep refreshing the page to see mine load. While I doubt anyone has any interest aside from myself, one never knows!
---
**Tipa** writes: lol... I do that, too.

**Pete S** writes: Just installed it. BTW, if you go to "Add New" under Plugins on your dashboard, you can just point to the zip file and it installs fine. (I was too lazy to fire up FileZilla. :) )

It works great! My only "gripe" is with XFire, which seems to lag so far behind. 

But here's what's strange. Last night, I played LOTRO.

I 'auto-tweeted' the following today: "played The Lord of the Rings Online for 1:14 http://gamerdna.com/r/qQx"
GamerDNA is "fed" from XFire.

If I go to my profile on the XFire page, it says exactly what your plug-in says, that I played TCOS and Gametap (which I did, but that was last weekend).

So somehow, GamerDNA is more up-to-date than the XFire website is, even though it gets its data from XFire.

I don't know if they're using a different API or what. 

I wonder if GamerDNA has an API? If so, I'd love (to make more work for you!) to have a plug-in that reflected that data since they collect data from XBox Live, as well as allowing users to enter gameplay data by hand.

Hmm, all of which sounds like bitching, and I don't want to sound like I'm bitching because I love what you've done so far and I'm definitely leaving it on my blog!

**Tipa** writes: XFire has been really wonky lately. I played LotRO for hours last night, and it lost it all. The minutes it has up there are those I spent in game this morning. It has ignored from TCoS time, etc. 

GamerDNA *does* have an API, but it doesn't currently give any list of gaming events that it uses to make its daily tweet. Or it isn't public.

Looks like MS doesn't let just anyone use their XBL API, or I could go get it myself. Which I'd prefer, since having to depend upon middlemen just adds more ways things can go wrong.

**Pete S** writes: Found a small bug. I was playing King's Bounty last night, and the ' is causing some ruckus with the plugin. It shows up as "s Bounty". Just needs an escape I imagine.

**Tipa** writes: Thanks!!!! And this is why I hate PHP (the programming language).
---
**Tipa** writes: There's a new version -- v0.5a -- which should fix this problem. Thanks for the bug report :)
---
**Pete S** writes: I just downloaded Version: 0.5b and the problem persists. :( 

It might be that something is cached in wordpress though. I removed the widget, deactivated the plugin, removed the plugin, then installed the new version, activated it... and the widget was already in place in my sidebar with my XFire name and all that. So somewhere Wordpress is keeping my settings. I only see 3 xfire rows in wp\_options though, and none of them are 'cached data'

So it might be that the fix won't show until something refreshes from XFire?

If I figure anything else out I'll comment again!

**Tipa** writes: Ugh, okay. Actually... well, I am looking at it now.

**Tipa** writes: It's been fixed. Parser was sending stuff weird.

**Pete S** writes: Wonderful, thank you!
