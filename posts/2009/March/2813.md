# Acclaim Spellborn client available for download

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-03-06 12:36:01*

From Acclaim's Community Manager, Historian, comes this news via Twitter:

> The Official Spellborn Download for Acclaim is up on our forums.


... and when asked if those accepted into the beta test would know by checking their account status at the [Acclaim site](http://spellborn.acclaim.com), or if there would be an email, replied:

> most likely checking your status will be faster than the email.. but If I get word people have been activated I will post it.


So there you have it. Spellborn is finally going live in the US. See you in the Deadspell Storm... if I get into the beta, and the NDA (if any) lets me post about it.
