# Gatheryn, Steampunk-based casual MMO, out this summer?

*Link has been fixed. SORRY!*

Ars Technica has a [more detailed look at Gatheryn](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2009/03/gatheryn-a-steampunk-mmo-with-lots-of-potential.ars) than I've seen anywhere else (including at Gatheryn's site!). 

Gatheryn is a Steampunk based game, set in an alternate history where the Information Age and the Industrial Revolution collided -- cyberpunk set in the Victorian/Edwardian era.

Gatheryn's gameplay should be familiar to players of Puzzle Pirates, Neopets and other casual MMOs of that ilk. There is no combat, no kill ten rats and no dying. You complete your missions, quests, crafting and so on solely through minigames, which are said to be Steampunk versions of the top 50 web games.

Which doesn't immediately make me very excited. Themed versions of popular minigames seem to be all the rage these days -- kids MMO Wizard 101 uses similar minigames (with a wizard theme) as a means to regain mana.

But, the MMO world is really short on Steampunk MMOs of any sort, and heck, dressing up in Victorian clothes, but with a robot arm holding the leash of your clockwork monkey, well, that'll be worth a look or two.
