# Wizard 101 shared bank! Green clothes! Voices!

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-03-12 11:12:24*

Wizard 101 added shared bank slots, voice overs to all quests in Wizard City and Krokotopia, and the St Patrick's Day RMT gear in today's patch. Gamer's Daily News has [a full description](http://www.gamersdailynews.com/story-9426-Wizard101-Finds-Its-Voice.html) of the new changes, and I'll be posting all the details after I get into the game tonight.

Thanks to [Game Mom](http://twitter.com/gamemom) for the heads-up!

Now I have to go farm up all that gear again!!!! YAAAY! Now I'm definitely getting my homework done here at work so I can play all night tonight!!!

Now, if they would introduce a gold/crown blind currency exchange, I'd consider W101 to be nearly perfect.

SHARED BANKS :) I think I have to go make six alts now!

I feel guilt for leaving Suri unfinished in ROM but once I hit max level I'm sure I'll feel the need to roam since the end-game is a bit sparse.
