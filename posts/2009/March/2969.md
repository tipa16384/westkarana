# XFire Wordpress Widget

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-03-26 00:53:22*

... if I could draw your attention to your right, especially you Wordpress bloggers ...

I've written a Wordpress Widget that shows your gaming (via XFire) for the past week. It still has one or two ~~bugs~~ ~~issues~~ challenges before I can release it publicly, but if anyone has any ideas of what they would like to see in such a widget, like sorting, or yes for times/no times, or live information or whatever... let me know.
