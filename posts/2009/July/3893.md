# Wizard 101: New Bazaar is Go!

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-07-22 05:54:25*

The Gobblers have finished moving the old Bazaar into the basement and have set up the entirely NEW Bazaar for our buying pleasure! Here's the info straight from Professor Greyrose:

**New Bazaar!**

Elik has updated his Bazaar in Olde Town. The new Bazaar allows players to sort items based on name, quantity, school, level and cost. 

When you first arrive at the Bazaar, everything will be sorted by name. As you can see from the following picture, there's a yellow arrow under the word 'Name'. Click the word Name to sort from A to Z or Z to A.

If you'd prefer to sort by the quantity of an item, click the top of the column with the # sign. You can sort from high to low, or low to high. 

![byquantity](../../../uploads/2009/07/byquantity.jpg "byquantity")

If you'd prefer to sort by level, click the letters LVL at the top of the column. Again you can sort from high to low, or low to high.

If you'd prefer to sort by school, click the top of the SCH column. A small spiral image indicates the item can be used by any school.

![byschool](../../../uploads/2009/07/byschool.jpg "byschool")

Finally, if you'd prefer to sort by cost you can do so by clicking on the top of the column with the word Cost. You can sort from high to low and low to high.

![bycost](../../../uploads/2009/07/bycost.jpg "bycost")

If you only want to see items that your current character can use at this time, select the Usable checkbox in the lower right corner of the window. This will filter out all items that you cannot currently use due to level or school restrictions. 

We all hope that you will find shopping at the new and improved Bazaar an easier and faster experience.

I believe the reason they removed the super powered clothing is because people would just get that and there was no reason to farm instances for loot because everything you got wouldn't be that great.

I do think they have swung the pendulum back too far the other way, and they could boost them a *little*. Add a card :)
