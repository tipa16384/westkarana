# Evony and Irony: Why I will never play this game.

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-07-10 07:34:56*

No blogroll for today, I'm the on-call developer this week AND I've been moved to a project at work with a daily morning meeting starting this week, so it's a time of adjustment.

One game I am not playing is a browser game called Evony, which promises something like EVE's skill training. I know nothing more about it, and I won't. Why? Because they are SPAMMING MY BLOG.

Here's just their latest attempts to spam comments into my blog -- all with fake email addresses attached:

I just started playing this new game called evony. It’s pretty sweet I think you guys would like it. Just a simple little flash game, but damn its addicting. You can sign up for an account at evony.com.
