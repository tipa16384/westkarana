Yesterday, EverQuest launched its new 51/50 server to [rave reviews](http://mmoquests.com/2009/07/01/random-game-news/), and this morning, Wizard 101 launches its [latest expansion, Grizzleheim](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2009/06/tons-of-exclusives-mannequins-go-live.html). 

So many cool things happening, but who has the time to play them all?

Inspired by the Star Wars: Galaxies news out of SOE's Fan Faire last weekend, Werit jumped into the game after some time away and [found a lot to like](http://werit.blogspot.com/2009/07/in-galaxy-not-so-far-away.html) with the new battlegrounds, player-created content and factions wars. He even has some video!

Naamah at Aionic Thoughts [faces a problem common to a lot of pre-release testers](http://aionicthoughts.wordpress.com/2009/07/01/the-beta-conundrum/) -- beta burnout. You like a game and you want to play it, but do you do it all in beta or hold off on serious play until the game goes live? Naamah decides to just jump right in to the beta leveling. Me, I might poke my head in once or twice, but I'm going to wait for the live game.

Lazaretto of Complete Heal has the [news from the trenches](http://www.completeheal.com/?p=1314) of EQ's newest server, Mayong. Want to join a group but still a little rusty from being plopped into a new level 51 character? Spend that time getting used to playing again... it's worth it!

Big news yesterday was that Spellborn NV has apparently gone bankrupt, and its publishers, Frogster and Acclaim, [have decided to turn it into a free to play game](http://phpbb.acclaim.com/spellborn/viewtopic.php?t=4666&sid=89f4883fb327fdea5dea60cbb2c5e73f) by the turn of the year. [This comes as no surprise to any Acclaim-followers](http://epicdolls.com/beauturkey/?p=1728), since F2P is their strong suit and the Spellborn subscription model always seemed an odd fit for them.

Cities XL has lifted their NDA, and [Massively's Shawn Schuster has a complete run through the current beta](http://www.massively.com/2009/06/30/massively-hands-on-with-cities-xl/). It's Sims 3 meets Sim City meets Civilization, but is it really an MMO?

Metaplace introduced embeddable virtual worlds yesterday (in a day already bursting with news). Any Metaplace world you can think of, you can put anywhere you could put a YouTube video. Cuppy, Metaplace's community manager, has [an amazing Steampunk world embedded right in the middle of a blog post](http://www.cuppycake.org/?p=823). Very cool. Raph Koster has [more info and the full press release](http://www.raphkoster.com/2009/06/30/embed-virtual-worlds-anywhere/) on his blog, as well.

Lots of stuff going on! So much so that I can't figure out what to play...

Anyway, see you tomorrow, and keep gaming!
