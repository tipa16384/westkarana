# Wizard 101 gift cards galore!

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-07-15 18:42:41*

I think this might be old news, but here it is: KingsIsle is sending out truckfulls of gift cards to department stores and electronics outlets the world over. Using Crowns garnered by redeeming the gift cards in game is, by far, the cheapest way of enjoying W101. You pay as you go, don't pay when you don't play, and you never lose access to areas you have already bought, even if you never play again.

They're a good deal, and they're pretty much everywhere, now.

Wizard101 players enter the magical world of Wizard City as student Wizards setting out to hone their Wizard skills, cast spells and summon powerful creatures to fight evil forces. The characters and worlds of Wizard101 are influenced by literature, history and pop culture, giving the game a depth and quality appreciated by adults and enjoyable for families to play together.
