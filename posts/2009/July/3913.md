# Chronicles of Spellborn's European servers to close

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-07-23 20:44:26*

According to news sites [T-Online](http://spiele.t-online.de/c/19/47/40/86/19474086.html) and [GameZone](http://www.gamezone.de/news_detail.asp?nid=75821), Dutch-developed Fantasy MMORPG Chronicles of Spellborn will be shutting down the Frogster-operated European servers at the end of July. European players may have their characters transferred to the Acclaim-operated American servers by filling out [a form on the Acclaim site](http://spellborn.acclaim.com).

The article goes on to say that Spellborn will be relaunched in 2010 as a Free2Play game, funding itself with a cash store that will sell gear and character services. Upon relaunch, Frogster will again operate the European servers.

**Sente** writes: Yeah, they announced "end of July" on the 17th and then shut it down on the 20th. (http://www.tcos.com/en/index.html)
A few people was pissed off by it, since there wer enot a real chance to do some "end of server" event.

Probably someone realized over the weekend that they had planned to have it done by end of July rather than start the work then.
Migration of EU accounts to Acclaim server seems to have started (http://phpbb.acclaim.com/spellborn/viewtopic.php?t=4839&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0&sid=721b21548695ac0e4e956c2e7a4f0c95) and they have underestimated the time for it. Initial estimate 4-5 hours and judging from the forums posts it is now over 50 hours and not done.

**We Fly Spitfires** writes: Must be a shame for all of the European players. At least they can keep playing but the lag wouldn't be great.

**Sente** writes: The lag part does not have to be bad, it can be good enough. But with Spellborn's combat system it will be more sensitive to lag issues than traditional MMO combat.
