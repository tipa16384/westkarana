# Wizard101: Five little things

I've been playing a lot of Wizard101 lately, working on getting my characters to level 20 so that I can explore Grizzleheim. The game is so close to being perfect that when you get snags, you notice them all the more. Here are a few things that would make the experience all the better.


 2. **Appearance Slots:** With so many outfit choices available, it would be wonderful to wear one outfit for its stats, and another for its looks. It would clearly be a huge UI hit to have to worry about three more outfit slots, but maybe it could be done another way? What if you could make and dress a special mannequin, and whatever IT wore, you would appear to wear? Or you could talk to a certain NPC who, for Crowns perhaps, would cast a spell that let you keep the appearance of whatever you wore at that moment, until you requested they cancel that spell?

 4. **Crafting by commission:** Currently, the only way to craft something for someone else is to make the object, sell it on the Bazaar, and have them buy it -- for insane amounts of gold. What if, while you were crafting, the crafting station would ask if this item should be delivered to a wizard standing nearby? There needs to be a way to make something for another character without them having to spend a pile of treasure at the Bazaar.

 6. **Purchase by Quantity:** Crafting requires vast amounts of material. Can we at least get a slider or something so when I'm purchasing 33 amethysts or something, I can just do it all at once?

 8. **Take a look at variable pricing on reagents in the Bazaar:** The Bazaar has a subtle pricing feature; it pays less for items of which it has many, and sells items items for more when you already have several. If you're buying a few dozen acorns from the Bazaar for crafting, watch the price creep up as you buy more. Variable pricing is fairly cool in that I can't flood the Bazaar with just hats that are too expensive for someone to buy; I have to branch out into other items of gear.

 10. **Allow trading reagents through the shared bank:** Why can't we share reagents? I have a bunch of resources on my alt that I can't give back to my crafter main without selling them at the Bazaar first.




I can't imagine I'm the only one who'd like to see these features?

**Quantize** writes: You're not. It's funny how a lot of the features you think would be nice have to do with crafting. After all the complaints about crafting from the community, I expect KI to eventually make some much needed changes. They are usually pretty good about that, here's hoping they keep on it!

**[Tesh](http://tishtoshtesh.wordpress.com/)** writes: Aye, these are pretty simple things. A full crafting suite really doesn't work with the sort of straitjacketed economy and trade functions that W101 has. I can understand why they went with the constraints, but shoehorning crafting into it just doesn't work. (I suppose that similar arguments could be made about the PvP in the game.)
