![The Resurrection of Mythos?](../../../uploads/2009/08/mythostease.jpg "The Resurrection of Mythos?")

Apparently, Diablo-esque MMO [Mythos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythos_%28computer_game%29), formerly developed by the [Diablo-esque developers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship_Studios) of Diablo, who lost the rights to their game to Korean publisher [HanbitSoft](http://www.hanbitsoft.com/about/company/about_hanbit.asp), is apparently ... coming. Details are slim, but it looks as if Redbana, publishers of the [online dance game Audition](http://audition.redbana.com/), will also be taking on a newly relaunched Mythos. Head to [the Mythos site](http://www.mythos.com/) to sign up for the beta... [Thanks to Heartless\_](http://hgamer.blogspot.com/2009/08/mythos-something-is-coming.html) for spotting their solitary tweet on Twitter about this!

And I gotta agree with Heartless\_ -- the Overworld had some good parts (I loved the new city), but I preferred the instanced world.

Warhammermer explores the darker side of super-cute Asian MMOs with [two frankly disturbing videos](http://exploringwar.wordpress.com/2009/08/14/luna-online-dance-videos/) from Luna Online. I won't be downloading this game because I like not being in jail.

If [you're gonna do a dance routine in-game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akAEd-4A4BA), it's gonna have to be the [Melancholy of Harumi Suziya](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5G5bD2Do-k) dance. It's an anime about a girl who believes she's the most important person in the entire world, but it must be kept hidden from her the fact that she actually IS.

Pete of Dragonchasers [bemoans the Achievement systems](http://dragonchasers.com/2009/08/13/achievements/) that tend to drive modern MMOs and other games, and it's nothing but yawn until -- hey, wait, I can dress up my XBox Live avatar by unlocking achievements? WIN!

Suzina of Kill Ten Rats opines that the BEST achievements are [the ones that give intangible rewards](http://www.killtenrats.com/2009/08/13/elitestatus/) because, hey, if the reward is beneficial in some way, everyone will just put their shoulder to the GRIND-stone until they, too, get it, like with the Force-sensitive slot in Star Wars: Galaxies. It's not a real achievement if EVERYONE has it.

The folks at KTR were busy yesterday. Ravious [found a lot to nod about](http://www.killtenrats.com/2009/08/13/another-casual-player-definition/) as LotRO dev Orion [defined the casual player](http://my.lotro.com/orion/2009/08/12/day-14-a-tale-of-a-design/) as someone who had a lot of demands on their time, of which only one was gaming.

And lastly, [the final word on Evony](http://www.ommatidia.org/2009/08/13/evony/). (okay, so I'm not sure that has anything to do with the GAME Evony... [but do their advertisement](http://www.lazygamer.co.za/general-news/a-history-of-evony-ads-the-insanity-continues)s? I rest my case.)

Thank your randomly generated deity who you may (or may not) worship and you may (or may not) make offerings to and who may (or may not) influence your character in game, IT'S FRIDAY!
