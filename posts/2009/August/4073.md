Blizzard announced today that all the rumors about their forthcoming expansion were true. Players will be able to play werewolves, and they're going to need all the werewolves they can get to meet the demand. Werewolf Bob can't let this opportunity pass him by.

It's the people you leave behind that hurt the most.
