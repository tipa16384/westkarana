# Wizard 101: Name the Turtles!

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-04-20 10:00:15*

[![Name the Marleybone Turtle!](../../../uploads/2009/04/builderturtle.jpg "Name the Marleybone Turtle!")](../../../index.php/2009/04/20/wizard-101-name-the-marleybone-turtle/builderturtle/)

I come from a big family, so big that Mom didn't even bother to name us! It was always "Hey, you!" and "That one, no not you, that OTHER one!" and "Everyone to my LEFT, time for dinner. Everyone to my RIGHT, homework time!". On my birth certificate, it just says "Baby Turtle #117".

Well, when Headmaster Ambrose hired me and my brothers and sisters to come to work building homes and islands for all the students of Ravenwood, I said, I will come, but under one condition. And Headmaster Ambrose asked, in that kind voice he has, what that condition was. I explained to Ambrose that we were all very proud of the homes we make -- we turtles carry our home everywhere, so we very much want them to always be at their best! And that when we built a home for a Ravenwood student, we wanted them to be able to tell people who built it for them. We need names!

Headmaster Ambrose thought this over for awhile, and then he agreed! He said that he was not wise enough to name all of us himself, but that he would ask the students, because in all his long years at Ravenwood, he had never seen a more clever group.

Now, Ambrose tells me I am going to be building homes for wizards who would enjoy living in Marleybone. I've drawn up the plans, gathered the materials -- all I need to know is my name so I can get started!

Won't you help? Fill in the form below with your Wizard101 username and what you think my name ought to be, and send it in! I couldn't be happier to know you're going to be helping!

My brother and sister builder turtles need names, too! Help name the Wizard City turtle by [visiting the Wizard 101 website](https://www.wizard101.com/site/home2/wizard101/page_8ad6a4041fea461f01207c374f82158a) (but I bet you already went there!). My friends at Wizard101 Central are helping [name the builder turtle for Krokotopia](https://www.wizard101.com/site/home2/wizard101/page_8ad6a4041fea461f01207c374f82158a)! The Friendly Necromancer's readers will [name the builder turtle for Moo Shu](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/), and the last of us, the one who will brave the monsters of Dragonspyre to make the grandest homes of them all -- well, you'll have to [follow the Ravenwood professors](http://twitter.com/Wizard101) on [Twitter](http://twitter.com) to find out how to name that turtle.

Prizes? You bet there are prizes! Aside from being the one to name us, the first wizard who submits the chosen name will win a Very Rare Housing Item for their house! WOW! And even if you weren't the first to choose my name, you get 101 Crowns just for suggesting the winning name!

There are a couple of rules, of course. First rule is, I get the BEST name! Heh... well, no, not really.
