# Wizard 101: All ten player houses

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-04-26 09:04:12*

I read on [The Friendly Necromancer's site](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2009/04/fwd-free-gold-on-test-realm.html) that little leprechauns had appeared all over Wizard City, ready, willing and hoping to give everyone who talked to them 50,000 gold.

So, my excited overspending on [the first night of housing](../../../index.php/2009/04/23/wizard-101-player-housing-on-test/) on the Test realm, was erased! When I logged in, I found more than that had been erased -- all the characters had been reset, and I had all my original money back but had to buy those islands again.

With the leprechaun's help, I bought ALL TEN homes, just so I could bring them here as sort of a virtual real estate agent's storefront window.

Moo Shu small island

Dragonspyre small island

Dragonspyre large island. It's a tower. You remember Dragonspyre towers, right?

I also noticed a section on the left side of the screen which showed icons of all the stuff you have recently won in battles -- VERY handy if you miss the text after the battle, or can't figure out what that item WAS.

Wizard 101 continues to add features that truly make this, in my opinion, the very best of the Family MMOs.

**[The Friendly Necromancer](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com)** writes: Awesome. Think I will go try before I buy. How was the Marleybone housing? Wasn't that the one you were most excited about?

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: I was thinking about Marleybone, but I don't like the layout. Being shrouded in night, Marleybone and Dragonspyre are both essentially gloomy. I never did like Krokotopia much, so that really leaves Moo Shu and Wizard City as candidates -- and of them, I like Wizard City best. I can still decorate it with the combined loot of five worlds, though.

**[jordan](http://wizard101)** writes: Can you try to make the member ship amout a little bit lower? Plz!? Cause i really want to be a member but my mom and dad said trhat its to much money and it sucks when i have a lot of quest to do but i have to be a member! Being a member makes you lvl up faster, but its too much money! I hope when i grow up i get to be a member. Like When i get my own credit card. I'm only 10. and i have a wizard. But i am addicted to wizard 101! I mean i LOVE it! Its so much fun! Exept not being a member. :( I always wanted to be a member so its not too hard for me to do the quests! And again plz try to lower the prices on member ship amounts cause i really, really, want to become a member! So i can do my quest already! But thank you for listening! :)

**Molly Isabella Chloe** writes: Hey Tipa. Could you search around for the prices for each of the houses and then post em. Or maybe just post a link to a place where I may find the prices? I am trying to save up for a house but I spend gold right after I get it (spent my last gold on clothes in marlybone hehe). Thx! 8-)
