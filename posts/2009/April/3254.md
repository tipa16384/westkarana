You can talk about it now! Expect an article about it for tomorrow, but if you've been playing -- how did you like it?

Oh thank the maker! 

Now I guess I better write something about it too, huh?

**Green Armadillo** writes: I'm looking forward to tomorrow. Seems pretty silly for them to have let so many people in without lifting the NDA in the first place.

**Ziboo** writes: I hadn't heard that - good to know. Interesting game.

**Pete S** writes: I played twice. It just didn't grab me, really. Might have been my mood though. Feeling short on time and frazzled probably isn't a good time to start playing an MMO with so many tutorials front-loaded. I'll definitely give it another go after launch.

**Rocknrollchicken** writes: I loved the game. Having 2 kids that are 7, and a 9 year old who play W101, this game will have so much more to do. The chance to play many careers, and not stick to just one will keep them from getting bored. From someone who has been with Sony from the beginning, this is a good one from them.

**Anonymous** writes: I found it pretty uninteresting. Standard hack n slash combat had me wanting more after playing W101. Camera controls were pretty lackluster as well ... it generally looked pretty though.
