# New header!

*Posted by Tipa on 2009-04-05 09:13:12*

Thought it was time the old blog got a bit of a face lift. First up: A new header image that replaces the rotating headers of before. It takes up less bandwidth than the others which will help in my bandwidth costs, and it's more "West Karana" than before :)

Graphics done with Inkscape, the open source drawing/illustration program. Font is Cooper MT Medium Bold from MyFonts.com. The objects on which the stuff was based are from SOE's EVERQUEST! Of course! The griffon was trucked in from North Karana for the photo shoot.

**Tipa** writes: No, not really. Well, some parts of it I REALLY like, but there are many parts I can't stand, and it has a bunch of bugs which very much frustrated me while I was making this. Half the griffon's wing would clip for some reason. The blurry letter shadows would sometimes snap into focus. The price was right, though.
