[IGN has the scoop on Wizard 101's next expansion, Grizzleheim](http://pc.ign.com/articles/995/995096p1.html). The article goes into a little detail about the three main clans of Grizzleheim, the war-like Bears, the cunning Wolves and the mystical Ravens. And as a tidbit, at the very end, [it looks like Thomas was right on the money](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2009/06/will-grizzleheim-be-released-on-test.html), as the article mentions that Grizzleheim goes live on Test today.
