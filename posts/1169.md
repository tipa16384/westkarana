# Good blogs make good neighbors.

I was surfing around through the Wordpress site, looking for ways to make my blog even yet more awesome, when I followed a link to Technorati, did an ego search on my own blog and had a bit of a WTF moment when I found I had more "authority" than a lot of blogs way more popular than mine.

Because of the weird way they calculate this, based on referring links, I realized that I have been a bad neighbor. As a blogger, instead of leaving long comments on other people's blogs, what I *should* do is make a small comment, then go into greater detail on my own site while pointing back to the original article on the other blog.

That's what blogs are for, right?

So resolution for me and, I hope, for other bloggers who want to help their neighbors: If someone writes something interesting, comment about it on your own blog and link back! Sure, this is Basic Blogging 101, but I've been taking and not giving back by just leaving comments on other people's blogs but not giving any link-back love from my own.
