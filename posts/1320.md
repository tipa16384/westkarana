# EQ2: Nice while it lasted -- Clan of Shadows declines the haffer

After a month, the large portion of which was spent waiting outside raid zones or off playing alts or other games rather than just wait around, Clan of Shadows decided it didn't really need another troubador after all. Wasn't any real surprise. I'd been expecting it ever since we they hit Veeshan's Peak. It's a shame, I'm not happy about it. They were great people and I was really good friends with a lot of them. They gave me the option of sticking around for another two weeks for another vote, and maybe even two more weeks after that for a third, but that's kind of desperate. I don't know if I could really take another month waiting outside Veeshan's Peak, maybe occasionally coming in to help clear trash until the real raiders showed up, hoping to somehow convince people I was worth having around.

I was depressed after. I didn't know what to do. The guild was so *right*, everything I wanted. The right times, the right balance between grouping and raiding, and of course, they were excellent at raiding as well. Oh well, so it goes. Good luck to them, and anyone need a 80 troubador, flagged for Veeshan's Peak? Or an 80 heavily armored battle cleric? :)

I'd left Revolution about a year ago, I guess, when the guild leader went AFK and I had a chance with Eternal Chaos. The leader has just come back and I asked for an invite back and he let me back. Revo is a PST guild so it's not a place I can stay, but at least there's friendly voices in guild chat. I hate playing by myself! I joined a random pickup group and did CoA and Chelsith, but ya know, it was a lot more fun with CoS peeps.

Guess I'll get over it. Wish I hadn't donated those four masters to the guild. In retrospect, I should have held on to them until I was made full member.
