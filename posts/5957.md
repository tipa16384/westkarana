This mysterious e-mail just mysteriously appeared in my in-box. My in-box OF MYSTERY!

I can neither confirm nor deny that I will be leveling my lower gluteal regions over the weekend as a warrior brought from the past to defend the Vigil against the rifts -- and from the evil warriors summoned from the future by the Defiant. E.g., the folks that were the community of the first beta event.

Here's Trion's official teaser on the matter:


> **Guardians of the Vigil** 

The Vigil has raised an army from throughout Telaraâ€™s history, as the people cry out for saviors. Only the strength of the Guardians can seal the rifts and keep the Defiant from destroying the world. Join the Guardians to drive back the planar forces that threaten Telara!

Play to Win! Survive Mathosia and you could be eligible to win an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 video card! Terms and conditions apply, click here for details. In-Game Prize Packs will be given away to ten (10) select players who complete the objective!



The first "winning condition" was to escape the apocalypse at the end of the world and get to Freemarch, the Defiant stronghold in the past. What Mathosia is and what must be done to survive it in the second event? No idea.

And you won't read the answer here! Thanks NDA!
