# New header!

Thought it was time the old blog got a bit of a face lift. First up: A new header image that replaces the rotating headers of before. It takes up less bandwidth than the others which will help in my bandwidth costs, and it's more "West Karana" than before :)

Graphics done with Inkscape, the open source drawing/illustration program. Font is Cooper MT Medium Bold from MyFonts.com. The objects on which the stuff was based are from SOE's EVERQUEST! Of course! The griffon was trucked in from North Karana for the photo shoot.
