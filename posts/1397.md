#EQ2: A Bard's Dream, an Epic Done#

I had only an hour left on my Maidens instance. If I couldn't get it done in that hour, I'd have to start Maidens from scratch, and it would have to wait another day.

Sunday, I was incredibly excited about getting my epic, the Ayonian Axe. I had the absolutely most perfect Maiden's group imaginable -- a guardian, a coercer (Wrapye, who has always been there to help for YEARS now...), me, a ranger for dps, two healers... and we owned the zone. But a couple of deaths on the Sisters and the tank and one of the healers, who belonged to the same guild... ported out. The others soon followed. I was standing alone in Maiden's, and I wasn't going to get my epic that day.

Yesterday... ah, now that was a day to remember. We plowed through Thuuga to start, then headed to the Throne Room of Kor-Sha to take on the Overking -- and we got him. It was sweet and easy and you could just FEEL the electricity in the guild. What I consider the hardest fight on the path to Veeshan's Peak was done. We zoned out, killed the instance, zoned back in and cleared up to the twins before we called it a night.

I asked in guild if anyone would want to finish up my Maiden's instance, and just like that, I had a full group, all guildies save for the enchanter, who was a friend of the conjurer's. Once we compensated for the berserker's unavoidable AE attacks in the sisters fight, we took them down easily, moved on to Drusella and SHE went down without a problem. Well, okay, there were a couple of problems dealing with damage shields (not mine) and aria (oops, mine), but nobody died except Drusella and she was dead and my soul key dinged and we had about ten minutes left before the zone expired.

I was supposed to look through some instruments scattered around the room; one of them would be my epic. Problem was: that room was EMPTY. There was nothing left in it. Minutes were ticking by and I could NOT find the damn things. In desperation, I portaled back up to the entryway and then back -- and there they were, all four of them. I clicked them all and my epic was the fourth one.

A Rhinemaiden appeared and attacked us, and I tried that axe out on her.

Mmmm.... felt good!

SO many people helped with the epic; it's not something you can do by yourself. I can think of ten people right off the bat, going deep into places like Chardok and Sebilis -- multiple times -- for me, or helping with various fights here and there. But that would only be the start of a long list (and maybe I'll go through my logs and make that list). But what I want to say is, thanks to my friends, and to the wonderful folk of Delusions of Grandeur. I've only been a member two weeks, but at no time have they ever treated me like anything less than a good friend.

Now I've got to head to Barren Sky and talk to someone there about an even greater plot, that will lead to the door of Venril Sathir himself... who, coincidentally, is on the kill list for tonight :)

Funny thing about that black dress (which you might recognize from my RoK beta tailoring page). I'd been scouting out Teren's Grasp for epic crafters with Dina while Dorah was getting updates in the Nettleville crafting group, and happened to stop outside the tailoring station. When I logged in last night, I was still there, and there was someone there, and what do you think they did? They asked me if I needed the tailoring update. Right out of the blue! I thanked them, but said I didn't. They turned back to their crafting, and I remembered this black dress from beta -- Lady's Dark Heart -- and asked if they could make it.

They could, and did, I gave them 10g and two bristled pelts for their time and had a new dress. 

Everyone is too damned kind in EQ2. I really need to resubscribe to WoW so I can appreciate EQ2 even more.
