# XKCD does shell!

*Posted by Tipa on 2010-04-01 06:13:40*

Today, the [XKCD webcomic](http://xkcd.com) page goes black as it simulates a Linux shell.

Here are a few things you might want to try:

`$ make me a sandwich
$ sudo make me a sandwich
$ shutdown
$ sudo shutdown
$ help
$ cheat
$ quit
$ wget http://google.com
$ man
$ cat
$ man cat
$ look
$ go south
$ light lamp`

or my favorite (from Internet Explorer):

`$ sudo apt-get upgrade`

Bunches of other fun commands :) You don't have to be much of a hacker to find them all. Just a little bit of one.
