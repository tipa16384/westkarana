The goblin spawner got stopped up. That's the only explanation why we were sitting in the King room in Sol A, mindin our own business, when suddenly seven, eight, ten goblins were dancing on our lower intestines. Between sudden goblin drop ships landing troops wherever we happened to be, having to keep apart from the other group, and the powerlevelers who used the place as their private reserve... well, by the end of the evening, corpses were piled high at the entrance, the goblins were very well fed, but most of us were pushing 30... and we had fun.

Sol A was the first place we've gone where we weren't the only people there. To their credit, the powerlevelers tried to stay out of our way, but there were so many of them...

In a pickup group, dying so many of times could only have ended in a lot of bad feelings. With a group of friends, taking risks, having fun... it was great. And for all the times we died, there were three times we might have died, but managed to pull it off, and those kinds of battles pay for the rest.

Next week is Butcherblock LDoN, and the week after... Mistmoore Castle.
