# W101: The Chamber of Fire, the Royal Hall and Sunken City

A friend was having trouble in the Sunken City and asked for some help. I was in a battle of my own and was low on potions, so I told him I'd be there in a few. Finished the battle, played a few rounds of my potion-filling minigames of choice, and the teleported to him.

If you want to talk about innovative gameplay mechanics, you have to understand how being able to teleport to friends and instantly be part of the battle and also get the quest for the instance automatically changes the game. The parts you don't need a group for, you can do yourself. When you need help, you look at your friends list, see whose free, and there's no travel time -- they're right there.

Given that everyone in the game is a wizard of some sort, it doesn't break any rules -- teleportation is one of a wizard's traditional powers. The open group system means that even if nobody has asked for your help -- you can see what they're up to anyway, and almost always the help is appreciated.

if you're level 5 and your friend is lever 40 and my teleporting in you made another monster join the fight, a monster your friend is going to have to handle, maybe you'll want to send your friend a tell before you pop over.

I spent the day helping out friends and working my way through the Pyramid of the Sun quests in Krokotopia. For a game where it doesn't make a huge difference what class you are -- what school of magic you learn -- the choice to take a support school like Life as my primary school was kind of questionable. Since everyone can heal themselves to some extent, why choose Life?

As I get higher level, I appreciate being able to absolutely keep someone alive even when they're being punished by three elite mobs and a boss, more and more. And I could never trust anyone else to heal me if I chose, say, the storm school, the highest damage school of them all, and kept drawing aggro.

Given that you can buy taunt and detaunt cards, the potential is always there to make groups with more traditional classes. But given that my secondary school, Fire, is at the exact same level as my primary school, Life, I can ditch the heals and just be a fire wizard (though without any benefit from power pips). It's all in which cards you put in your deck.

While we were in Sunken City today, someone said they had THREE schools of magic, and another person said they were thinking about taking FOUR. Which is, bluntly, insane. If you have extra points to spend, get those optional cards you can buy in Nightside and in the secret card store in Krokotopia.

Wizard 101 is still fun to play. Yeah, it's just doing card battles again and again, but I don't feel all tense like I do when playing Vanguard, where I think my computer is going to crash any second. It's just fun and relaxing and strategic; the kind of game where you're always learning, and where skill matters.

I just would like the game to explain the concept and benefits of 'focus fire' in some tutorial or something, so I wouldn't have to.
