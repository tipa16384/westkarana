# GigaBlast and Search Engine Mania

Whilst perusing the lists of bots indexing this blog, I noticed an unfamiliar name, [GigaBlast](http://gigablast.com). They search through blogs with a natural language interface, similar to what [Jeeves claimed to do](http://ask.com) but never quite managed.

My mission: Ask it something that would refer back to RP & RL!

**what is roleplaying and real life?**

Many of the interesting responses pointed to a game called "[My Life With Master](http://www.halfmeme.com/master.html)", a link I was hesitant to follow at work... but it's actually a pencil-and-paper roleplaying game about a minion who struggles with self-loathing and weariness as he obeys the commands of a capricious master. From the errata for the game:

> On page 41, near the five Epilogue constraints write, "But what of the minion whose Self-loathing plus Weariness is equal to their Love plus Reason? Such a one satisfies none of the five constraints. Surely this by Czege is an unforgivable omission! I submit that their Epilogue should be characterized by finding themself a new Master."


Google takes this same query and points to something indexed by its book search, "[Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible Roleplaying Game](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=what+is+roleplaying+and+real+life%3F&btnG=Google+Search)". Sounds like search engine bots have a pretty dim view of real life. All I get are horror responses...

I've known for a long time that no search engine ranks this blog high enough to display unless I plop lines and lines of verbatim text into it. Maybe I should narrow my focus; or just HAVE a focus, since at the moment it is very "whatever I happen to be into today".

**OH MY GOD!**

I just typed "Betraying Qeynos" into Google - and this was the NUMBER ONE SITE! Quick, everyone type that into Google... this is the first time I've even been on the first page...!

Running over to Yahoo! -- WOOHOO! Number three! And MSN?

Number one in MSN!

Wow, I am inflated with a puffy sense of self-importance....!

Gigablast... nope, not there yet... but they're trashy anyway. Ask.com - nope, but I already knew they didn't index this site. They index EZBoards though? People still use EZBoard? Wow... crammed with ads and popups, and they lose your forums, too.

Anyway. I can rest easy knowing that if I suddenly died, the fictional adventures of my fictional characters will live on without me.

One last thought: Is googling for your character's names more, or less, pathetic than googling for your own? Googling for my own is pointless, as I share my real name with a celebrity, and it's all about HER.

I'm apparently 62 years old, so speak really loud when you call. And type big.

**and one last thing** before I return to work... when this site relaunches under Wordpress, it will be called West Karana. 2 out of 3 blogs that link here call it that, and it IS the URL after all, so... that means I should probably abandon that "Secret of NIMH"-style theme I was working on and do something West Karana-ish.

**Ping!** I was kinda hurt that Google didn't include me in their list of Blogs; this blog only comes up in their normal web search. Turns out I wasn't pinging Weblogs.com, only Technorati.com. Am now pinging Weblogs, so maybe the blog crawlers will begin to read this site... I wanna be there when Umbria starts demographizing the hundred-year-old hobbit constituency.

**really on a blog roll today**

The thing that got me started on the whole "why is my blog not counted as a blog?" thing is the little note on [The Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/) (a great political read with a liberal bent) where they do smarmy [buzz graphs](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/harry-shearer/not-getting-quite-as-much_b_23588.html) (on the left there) to see what people are talking about on blogs.

I typed in the names of some MMORPGs to see how the buzz was doing. Everything was about where I expected it to be (and somehow, by some wild coincidence, I typed in the game names *in the exact high-to-low order* they would be placed!)

Honestly, I expected Warhammer to be lower in the buzz, and DAoC to be higher. It's sad, but I think it's clear DAoC will die before the game it borrowed so much from, EverQuest 1. EQ1 kept reinventing itself in ways DAoC did not; whereas the current EQ1 is a very different game from the one that launched in 1999, DAoC, at least the last time I played it last winter, is very much the same as it has always been.

Another oddity; how come people aren't talking more about WoW? It has 30 times the subscribers of EQ, yet only twice the buzz? You'd expect it to be proportionately more, but Warhammer, a game not even out yet, has all the buzz, while WoW, with its new 1.11 patch, barely beats it.
