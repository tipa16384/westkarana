#Welcome to Mayong, EverQuest's 51/50 server#

![Mayong Mistmoore, from the Legends of Norrath art book](http://westkarana.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/mayong.jpg "Mayong Mistmoore, from the Legends of Norrath art book") Thanks to commenter Wimp, who revealed that EverQuest's newest server, the one with the new "51/50" rule set (new characters start at level 51 with 50 AAs), has actually been (briefly) live and players have played on it.

The newest server, Mayong, named after the legendary vampire lord who is a villain in both EverQuest and EverQuest II, will (according to [this thread on Steel Warrior](http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?p=283030)) start new characters in Flawed Defiant armor, and spell books full of the spells to that level.

New characters on Mayong immediately formed up to take down some dragons, and it's pretty certain that Vox and Naggy won't get a chance to draw two breaths before some random raid takes them down once more.

But this is EverQuest -- [nothing stops YOU from being the dragon](http://westkarana.com/index.php/2008/06/28/being-lord-nagafen/), toasting random raids :)

See you opening day on Mayong!
