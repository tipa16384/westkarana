# Stout Henry and Vanguard

Due to the new character joining Stout Henry in his further adventures, AND due to me using Vanguard to generate illustrations for the story, Stout Henry was delayed until I'd leveled up a gnome enough in VG so that he could pose for screen shots. 

I finished that last night, and I think he came out pretty well :)

VG's Isle of the Dawn was still really laggy on my computer, but the superior gear that comes from it makes it a bad idea to skip it.

I started off with a blood mage, but quickly re-rolled him as a rogue. Rogues are pretty awesome :)

Vanguard is so close to being a great game. If it ran well on my laptop, and had a better UI (especially the map), I might be more inclined to give it a real shot. But when moving a character feels like pushing it through a room full of honey, I'm thinking too much about the game itself than getting into the character and forgetting the game entirely.

I expect Spellborn's character customization to be as good or better than Vanguard. That's likely going to be the end of VG on my hard drive, unfortunately.

Anyway. Story tomorrow...
