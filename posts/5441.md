In these social town/farm/empire/chocolate shop building games on Facebook, it's hard to see your entire place all at once. Even zoomed out in Frontierville, you can only see a fraction of your homestead -- and that, blurredly.

Enter [Autostitch](http://cvlab.epfl.ch/~brown/autostitch/autostitch.html). I took 46 individual pictures of my homestead, cut out the UI cruft, loaded them into Autostitch's demo and... it gave me this gorgeous overview of the whole thing.
