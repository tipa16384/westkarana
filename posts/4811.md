A new player survey pops up when you log into EverQuest these days, asking what sort of content players would like to see from the venerable MMORPG. Can an eleven year old game still innovate? These poll questions hint that SOE has not given up on the game that put them on the map:

Poll Question: What new feature would you be most interested in seeing in EverQuest?

*  UI Revamp -- Work with the community to come up with a new default skin for the EverQuest UI, with a possibility for other changes like re-sizable hot bars and backpacks (not increased slots, however).

 * Increased inventory space -- Revamp the inventory management system to allow backpacks larger than 10 slots.

 * Player housing -- Personal player houses with items that can be placed inside, a ranking system, access rights, etc.

 * Improved guild system -- Advanced guild rank management, guild halls that allow decoration and item placement (similar to player housing).

 * **Revamped bazaar/broker system -- Offline trading, trading outside of The Bazaar zone, etc.**

 * **New player character models -- Optional new player character models (any new visible armor would only be visible on the new models).**

 * More mercenary types -- New AI types like DPS, crowd control, etc.

 * **Player generated content system -- Allow players to place NPCs and traps, set mission types, and turn loose their custom zone for other players to experience and gain points in a scaling reward system.**




I've highlighted the ones I think are especially cool. Player-generated missions? YES, PLEASE!
