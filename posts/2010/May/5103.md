# LotRO: Save a horse, ride a hobbit!

Oh, this isn't a real post. Just was so happy to finally get a horse in Lord of the Rings Online. I don't subscribe to LotRO, but each time Turbine offers a free play weekend -- or week, in this case -- I log in and see if I can make enough to get a horse.

I was going to be riding last night. I WANTED the Spring Festival horse, but after doing a couple of the "spring leaf" events, I got bored and gave up on that project. I'd settle for the regular mount, if I could afford it.

I had auctioned off most of my 37 Captain's harvests and other gear a couple days ago; last night I did the same to my two alts. I ended up with 4 gold and 100 silver -- an all-time high. The riding quest was tedious -- ride a horse to Bree, Michel Delving and North Downs, ending with a race around the yard.

It was worth it in the end. I'm now the proud owner of [Brown Betty](http://watching-tv.ew.com/2010/04/30/fringe-season-2-episode-20/), my chestnut mare.

So; not a real post. Tonight is a non-MMO night, so tonight I will be (I hope!) starting my series of five IP's that SHOULD be made into MMOs. Tonight: #5: [Gunsmoke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunsmoke), the MMO.
