# Frontierville: the Panorama

In these social town/farm/empire/chocolate shop building games on Facebook, it's hard to see your entire place all at once. Even zoomed out in Frontierville, you can only see a fraction of your homestead -- and that, blurredly.

Enter [Autostitch](http://cvlab.epfl.ch/~brown/autostitch/autostitch.html). I took 46 individual pictures of my homestead, cut out the UI cruft, loaded them into Autostitch's demo and... it gave me this gorgeous overview of the whole thing.

Click on it to see it super-sized.
