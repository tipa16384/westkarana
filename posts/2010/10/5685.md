I'm more interested these days in the single player RPG version of 38 Studios' "Kingdoms of Amalur" than I am in its future MMO incarnation. My recent several play-throughs of Bioware's excellent "Dragon Age" RPG have firmly confirmed me as an RPG nut. When companies make their IPs into MMOs, they have to have some grind in there to slow people down. In single player RPGs, you're there to be part of a story. The very best RPGs provide a platform for your OWN story, but that's rare, indeed. Have there been any besides Oblivion's?

I don't know.

Anyway, I'm following news of "Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning" with great interest. I want it to be amazing. I want it to start a franchise that will keep 38 Studios' developing new games, because I definitely wouldn't want to bet their future on an MMO. I wouldn't give a dime for a new MMO's chances these days. Single player RPGs, well -- there's always room for a good one.

Today, the folks at 38 Studios sent out their first newsletter for KoA:R, which [links to an interview with Curt Schilling at Gencon](http://www.reckoningthegame.com/TheWell/Welcome) and a gallery of pictures. No great detail; in the interview he even admits that they'll be dragging out the news over a very long period of time (something which could backfire; people get impatient, and then they get bored, and then they lose interest).

Does anyone else totally think "[80's-era discussion boards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL)" when someone talks about "The Well"? Here's the text of the e-mail:
