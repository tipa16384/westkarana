# EVE Online: Do you hear the people sing?

It's been awhile since I've written about EVE Online; it's been awhile since I PLAYED EVE Online. It's my own fault, what happened. I'd left Otakudyne, a dead corp, for a nullsec corp. 

I found when I got there that nullsec was everything I didn't like. Having to continuously monitor three mandatory channels, with at least three more that would be need to be watched, having to be on voice chat whenever I played the game, not being able to two box, having to farm rats for money, having to abandon the invention business which was my only source of income (since I'd stopped running missions because they were boring).... The one night I spent in nullsec was a harrowing gauntlet of no fun at all.

I have a full time job; I play MMOs occasionally -- not every night, any more -- to relax and chat with friends. I often watch a DVD at the same time. I don't need people shouting in my ears.

I kept meaning to log in again and give it another shot, but there was always something better to do, something far less stressful. I have enough stress in my real life. When my subscription ran out, I didn't renew.

My second account, though, I'd subbed in one of their two-box promotions. It was a six month deal, and it's still active.

I'd heard [through the grapevine](http://shatteredblog.wordpress.com/) yesterday that my old corp, Otakudyne, had been wardec'd by a rival corp that wanted to set up a starbase at the exact location of OUR starbase. And so, ours would have to go.

Kasul continued and said that corp director (and sole remaining active member) "Red" Sredans was trying to save the base, but that things were not going well. The starbase had gone into "reinforced" mode, the 25 hour chance for the defenders to pull together a way to save a base that was under attack. Red was calling together a coalition to meet the enemy corp when the starbase left reinforced mode at 4AM this past morning.

All my good ships were on my main account, but I had some ships of note on the second account. I had my Prophecy battlecruiser, a beautiful looking ship, and my Amarr stealth bomber of which I was very proud. That bomber had been the perfect companion to the Ishtar on my main account.

The first job was to get all the station's guns back online, using remote armor and hull repair modules. I fitted a Mauler cruiser with several and started repairs, but the low cap on the cruiser meant I could run only one repair module continuously. This was almost pointless compared to the number of repair modules the battleships and battlecruisers pulled out, so I got my Prophecy and helped guard the station against the occasional enemy attack. We got one of them!

I had to sleep before we finished; this morning, the guns were back. The station was out of reinforced mode, and the enemy (based apparently in the UK and also apparently without jobs) was bombing the central core. I tried to take some of the heat from Red with the Prophecy, but I was scrambled and killed. I then did some sniping with the bomber, but I was scrambled, killed and podded. So I was out of ships.

This is, by the way, why it was stupid to have ever had the idea of joining a nullsec corp. Every single time I get into a PvP situation in EVE Online, I just get killed and usually podded. The only thing I could think of in my few hours in nullsec was how all my ships would, one at a time, be destroyed, and there I'd be, deep in nullsec with no ships or money and no way to play the game. What choice was there BUT to quit? I didn't even have the ISK to replace even one of my main ships, my Ishtar or my Domi....

Anyway, enough whining. I knew I would lose all my ships in the defense of the starbase, but what better way to go out than with a bang?

**Longasc** writes: I am sorry to hear of your loss. You did not mention it, but I fear the station succumbed to the enemy fleet. But the defense of the station of your old corp was honorable and brave, Mr. Worf assured me you won a deathtime premium account in Sto'Vo'Kor for your valiant actions.

I also stopped playing EVE at a certain point. It does not seem very friendly to small corps, and I do not think that a casual player has the social network and credit that other players are willing to risk their ships for the safety of his corps station. I also got tired of mission running and rare ship collecting at a point and pvp in EVE is either using cheap and expendable ships or having to work somewhat to replace major ship losses.

Did you lose your Dominix as well? I did not think you were that broke that you can't replace a T1 BB. But quitting EVE? I think you had quite some fun as inventor and producer. But yeah, if this is not enough anymore, I don't think you can have much fun as casual in Corp Wars. Maybe Stabs can elaborate how one could, but I doubt its possible.

**Vahz** writes: It was good to fly with you again Tipa. In my opinion we just had the wrong fleet for a Pos defence, A couple of RR BS with logistic support would have made a big difference. And not being in the Corp made it difficult for me (had to wait until attacked).
I have also since Otaku moved a majority of my ships into the Wh where I now live, so couldn't bring much to the fight. But was willing to lose a couple of cruisers in the fight.

As for EVE, I think honestly it can be fun at any sized budget or skill level. Since Otaku I've learned how to jump into pvp with just a few days training and a few million isk (less than 1 or 2). Yet at the same time I've learned how scary & fun it can be to fly a 1b+ isk ship. You do have to find a source of income to fund a pvp habit and sounds like you may have something going with the invention.

So what I'd recommend for any player jumping into EVE wanting some fun is to take a pvp basic class like the ones Agony Unleashed (www.agony-unleashed) put on, or join an alliance/CORP like PVP University where you can get some practical teaching in how effective low-cost ships can be in a fight and the ins & outs of each ship class. There must be no greater feeling than being with a fleet of t1 frigs taking down a carrier. =)

Missions in EVE are dreadfully boring, so is mining, so is trading. EVE at its heart is PVP, and imo is what makes it a blast. It's a shame CCP Games, has a hard time getting the PvE or new players into PvP aspect of the game. They have some great mechanisms for doing that (faction warfare etc), but still nothing from the game teaches a player how to jump into PvP and learn each ship class from a step by step classroom type setting. So players end up trying to fly Battleships or Tech 2 ships into PvP and get burnt on a heavy loss and never look back, with maybe an ending in quitting the game. 

Even if I lose a ship it's not a big deal, or was ran all the way out to highsec it wouldn't matter. I'd find a way back to the fight and either get some kills or give some good fights. CCP though needs to build that bridge to walking players through training on each ship class and using it in PvP. Perhaps through zones restricted to ship types, I dunno. Otherwise, CCP will leave it up to corps/alliances like Agony to teach players. Player education is not such a bad solution as I've had a blast each time I flew with Agony and having been having a blast living in a wormhole. It's been so long since I've flown about in k-space longer than an hour I had almost forgotten about life in Highsec. 

But I would say, give Agony a try, go on one or two (mileage may vary depending on the targets that day) of their basic roams, and maybe do a write up. I'd be interested in your thoughts & experience.

Sure beats a whimper. I usually whimper a lot, I just try not to do it too loud. :D

We're in the same boat (geddit?) -- I'm not a fan of PvP, I suck at it, and nullsec scares me. We'll see how long EVE remains appealing with those criteria. ;)

**Stabs** writes: I think there are times in Eve when the best move is not to play. It sounds to me like you've overdosed on all the negatives of Eve - losing ships, getting podded, the lack of communication and group play that dominates.

I would suggest you play something else until you get the feeling, "gah this is all so simple I need depth".

I've had a few breaks from Eve when I just thought I don't have friends, I'm going nowhere, I'm not effective, this is all pointless. What draws me back is the complexity.

If you're comfortable with the expense keep your account open and your skills training. But anyway just stop playing. Much as I love Eve it has a way of burning people out.

**Toldain** writes: @Tipa I saw that Etha was online last night and I wondered what was up. All the points about nullsec life that you bring up bothered me too, but now, after 6 months or so, they don't bother me so much. I'm doing invention myself now. The "on voice chat all the time" thing turns out to be a bit more flexible than it seems. 

It seems inevitable to me that Otaku's POS got blown up. I doubt if it was used much, maybe the smart thing would have been to sell it to someone. Or take it down as soon as you saw the wardec. 

I have, myself, been on the losing end of a POS bash. I accomplished next to nothing, and got myself podded 5 minutes after logging off. Not the most fun time I've had in EVE.

@Vahz, It's great to hear from you Vahz, and it sounds like you've been doing some pretty interesting stuff.

**Rer** writes: I'm sorry to hear that, if I had been on at the time I would have happily lent what little service my Vexor/(soon to be purchased) Megathron could spare. Still, that's admirable of you to go out with a bang defending the Corp like that.
