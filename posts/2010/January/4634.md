They usually end up late to the party on a concept, the DB sites using the model view idea for a while.
In the the end, though, when they show up it aslways polished to a level of beauty, and tremendously well executed.

A great addition to the armory.

**kaozz** writes: I thought it was pretty sweet.

And.. You can't pose your character in Aion like you can with this one ;)

**Callan S.** writes: I think it'd be better if they gave you something tangible (this doesn't even work if you've not played for a long while, as well as just being digital). Awhile back they had some company who could make a plastic figure of your character and mail it out - if you could earn these by playing somehow, that'd be cool.

@Pete S -- yup, always KT, I joined WoW the day the server opened.

@Callan -- well, you can also get prints made of your character....
