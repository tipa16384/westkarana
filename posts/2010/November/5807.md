I've been teaching myself the basics of modding Minecraft. So I've been toying with with Minecraft file format, and as a first test of my Python libraries, I turned all the dirt to obsidian, all the water to lava, all the trees to brick and their leaves to sponge.

Just... because I can.

Now everyone can see what the world looks like to me when I close my eyes....
