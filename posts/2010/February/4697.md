# Star Trek Online vs EVE Online, Part 4

*Posted by Tipa on 2010-02-14 15:13:04*

The survivors of the destruction of the USS Alvarado had discovered scantily-clad native girls along with an ancient wreck of what appeared to be a Starfleet vessel. Putting that mystery aside, the crew got busy, their work cut out for them.

Parts 2-4 were originally one really long comic. I split it into three parts and added a little more to make it easier to read. Next stop for the STO crew: Jita. There is no way they can prepare themselves for the mercantile capital of New Eden.

Plus the warp out without retrieving my drones, and buying something cheap on the market without realizing its in a nearby low-sec station.
