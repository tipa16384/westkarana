Okay, seriously? I get this ad on my adbar when I load up Facebook. Looks like some me-too Bejeweled clone, so already it gets a negative one zillion on the Tipa Cool Game Scale. BUT! WAIT! You can also ad(d) to your ~~pain~~ enjoyment by installing the "mywebsearch toolbar"! OMG! I was HOPING someone would let me install MORE SPYWARE ON MY COMPUTER!

Last company I worked as an IT admin. It was part of my job to go around and remove all the viruses and spyware that people would blithely install on their computers. That weather toolbar scam of a few years back? The COO had that on her computer. Spyware-laden screen savers which displayed ads as their save image? Head of sales for our most popular line had that on hers. Made me sick. But I wasn't allowed to lock down those computers so that nobody could install anything not approved by IT.

I don't work as an IT admin any more, but I got a deep respect for the job.

Seeing this blatant attempt to get people to install spyware on this computer makes me wonder just how stupid advertisers think FB people are. It makes me angry at Facebook for allowing this on their service, AND it makes me think less of every developer that develops for FB because, hey, what kind of crap are they installing in the background after I give them permission to use all my personal information?

Yup. Facebook thinks I'm an idiot. I don't feel bad. Apparently, I have a lot of company.
