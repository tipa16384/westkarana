# 7DRL Day 2: Monsters, Targets, Items

*Posted by Tipa on 2010-03-07 20:05:11*

My 7DRL entry is moving along, but it's not moving quickly. I'd said even before I started this that, given a full time job, how the game was at the end of Sunday -- today -- is how it would have to be.

I ALMOST got inventory in today; it is partially in, but I need to display it, and I will get to that, but it will likely be the last feature I implement. I need to start adding in the content.

So, plan for Monday night: Finish the inventory and add multiple floors. I'm sure glad that nobody will be playing this version. I have all sorts of ideas for how I might do it better. For one thing, I am backing away from making a 'Roguelike' that is a copy of Rogue. That's been done, hundreds of times. Looking at some of the other entries has inspired me to take a step away from normalcy and really focus on unique features -- I like the way my map looks, I think with some work I could expand on that kind of handmade look.

It doesn't seem so, but the game today is double the complexity it was yesterday. But I am failing at putting the fun in. If all I do is work on mechanics, I'll run out of time to add fun.

Note to self: need to add a scrolling message pane.

I wrote a media management library to handle all the images; it's pretty sophisticated, handles all the graphics except for the map itself. Pretty proud of how that's coming along.

The Pygame graphics library is slowly showing its power, as I get deeper into sprite management and layered groups. If nothing else, the NEXT game I write with Pygame should go a lot faster.

Note to self: Next game, we do that 2.5D perspective.

Here's the video. I don't know why the screen recording software adds those clicks.

Oh, please, no. I've played a few Roguelikes that used that perspective and it just never works out well.

Anyway, keep going! As I said, I'm eager to see how this turns out.

You didn't mention AI but those rats clearly have some. Is it "if player is closer than X then go to current position of player"?

**Tipa** writes: Actually, they follow the scent trail left by the player. By always moving to the square with the freshest scent, they will always get to the player. There is some code that tries to find the player if the trail is stale, too.

**mbp** writes: You gave the rats a sense of smell?! If this was anyone but you I would think you were pulling my leg but from the woman who wrote a whole blog about a neo-pets game I believe it.
