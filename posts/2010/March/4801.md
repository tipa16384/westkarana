# EVE Online: Nemesis Initiative update

On my fourth try, my Nemesis invention produced an actual blueprint. That's pretty fun, but what are the true costs? I wasn't able to find any Tristan blueprints on contract on which to base the invention, so I had to buy an original. That DOES give me a second avenue of profit, as I can sell Tristan blueprints at about 200K each. They don't move quickly, but they eventually do sell.

Each try at a Nemesis (or any tech II Gallente frigate) takes four datacores -- two for Gallente Starship Engineering and two for Mechanical Engineering. Those together are worth more than a million ISK on the market.





| Item | Cost |

| Tristan Blueprint Original | (2,542,500) |

| Set of Datacores (x4) | (4,000,000) |

| Nemesis bp price (expected) | 5,000,000  |

| Tristan bp copies sold (x4) | 800,000  |

| Total |
 (742,000) |





So with one success and given a side trade in blueprint copies, I'm still in the hole for three quarters of a million ISK. The price for Tristan copies is volatile and could quickly devolve into a price war, making that an unreliable source of income. Nemesis blueprints seem to be commodity priced at five million ISK, but it's hard to tell how fast they move. Let's say, since it takes 13 hours (call it a day) per attempt, and two days for the R&D agents to make enough datacores, that it is possible to make one Nemesis blueprint a week, at an average of four tries per success. That's an income of one million ISK per week. Combine that with invention line fees, and the trade is not looking too profitable, there.

So with this success, I am calling a close to the Nemesis Initiative. It's fun to make them, but the profit margins are less than doing a half hour level 3 mission, and substantially below the profits for a two hour level 4 mission. I may still make them now and again, but it's clear the profit for tech II cruiser blueprints far outstrips the tech II frigate trade, since the use of decryptors increases not only the chance of success, but the quality of the resulting blueprint.

What's next? I really want to get some Deimos and Phobos blueprints made, see how they do in the market. They should at least be as profitable as the Ishtar trade.

I can't even begin to imagine how much work must go into figuring out the market, and to make that profitable. Being such a new person to all of this I just find it extremely fascinating.

T2 ship production is DRASTICALLY unprofitable unless you have ready access to the products of moon mining, which I do not. And selling the Nemesis blueprint won't be an easy task; there are four for sale in the Sinq Laison region, and I don't want to take away what little profit I can make by undercutting. So I'm headed to another region that hadn't any for sale last time I passed through, and sell it there. Looks like there is very little demand for Nemesis blueprints.

Do they often tell you what your character is feeling, in EVE? I presume its for the character rather than telling the player what they are feeling.
