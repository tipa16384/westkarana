#EQ2: Tier 3 Tailoring#

Live Update #25 is bringing [new tailoring recipes](http://eq2.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g93) to EQ2 - casual clothes, just for looks.


I am all about looking good. It's why my defiler alchemist has a special robe for brewing potions, and why Dorah has a new robe every day. I just can't wait to get my crew in stuff like that below. Nashuya in particular is going to look *fantastic*.

Just have to get my tailoring up. I have been grinding it... from 22 to 27 in the past couple of days... limited only by **belladonna roots**. The new crafting system just makes them vanish. I have plenty of the boiled leather I need to get to the next tier, but it seems to take about 70-80 belladonna roots to get through each level. I have toned down the grinding on cloth armor a bit, but as backpacks (which use two roots, and haven't got *much* spam in them) recede in level, they give me less and less experience.


Seriously considering gathering a hundred more belladonna - which will take a couple of hours, even with the multiple harvests available - and then popping a tradeskill xp potion and seeing if that will get me to thirty. 


I started Dorah on her jewelcraft career this morning. What with jewelry and scout spells, she'll be able to easily level on pristine discovery xp, just as Etha does with alchemy. Tailoring gives you about four non-rare recipes per level. It just isn't enough to progress quickly.


I'm coming to understand that the scholars and provisioners have a real advantage over the other tradeskillers due to the sheer number of recipes they get.
