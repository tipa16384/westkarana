"It would like them much; but an ye wot how dragons are esteemed, ye would not hold them blamable. They fear to come." -- "Well, then, suppose I go to them instead, andâ€”" -- "Ah, wit ye well they would not abide your coming. I will go." And she did. She was a handy person to have along on a raid. -- *Mark Twain, "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"*

I work not half a mile from the house where Samuel Clemens wrote that book, and the book is my "bus book" I read on the way to and from work, and when I saw the lines about dragons and raids, well....

Anyway, [lots of people are still waiting in queues](http://biobreak.wordpress.com/2009/09/22/aions-producer-3-hour-queues-suck-it-up-wait-it-out/) in Aion. I think enough has been said about that, and I don't ding NCsoft for going easy on the servers to start off. (Rer has some ideas on [what to tell friends who might be reluctant to try Aion](http://insert-awesome-aion-name.blogspot.com/2009/09/aion-needs-you.html) because of queues and other things). Nothing worse than making a million servers [and then closing half of them in a couple of months](http://syncaine.wordpress.com/2009/09/22/launch-day-how-to-deal-with-day-one-in-the-post-wow-mmo-space/) after people go back to WoW. Because you KNOW they will. In the MMO space, WoW is like this huge dark star in the middle of the system. You can travel to another planet for a visit, but unless you nail your feet to the ground, that dark WoW star's gonna pull you back.

Seems only natural to want to work there. After all, if they already have your soul, might as well make them pay for the privilege. That's what Ixobelle thought, fresh back from Japan, as he drove to Blizzard headquarters in Irvine, California, with [$500 worth of full color, 27 page booklets outlining his painstakingly designed raid dungeon](http://www.ixobelle.com/2009/09/greetings-from-irvine.html), the Castle of Baron von Lupus. If that doesn't sound like a natural fit for the new Worgen PC race, what does? Not knowing any Blizzard employees well enough to get through the front gate, he set up a table and sign across the street, hoping for a response. Did it pay off? [You'll have to read the post to find out](http://www.ixobelle.com/2009/09/alas-defeat.html).

Brad McQuaid writes about [Vanguard's Size Problem](http://www.bradmcquaid.com/Brad_McQuaid/Blog/Entries/2009/9/22_Vanguard__Post-mortem_Part_4.html). As in, the world is so big, vast, tremendous, huge, etc that unless you stick close to the cities, you will only rarely see another person. Though with all the methods of travel available, 90% of Telon is just there to keep the quest hubs separated. Brad says this vast expanse was a pushback against EverQuest's omnipresent crowding that had people bumping into one another at every turn. But overcrowding is better than the alternative....

Brad says people will group if there's enough people in the area with which to do the thing. Thallian insists the reason people don't group (in WoW) is [because it's not FUN enough](http://thallians.blogspot.com/2009/09/making-grouping-fun.html). He goes on to give a lot of suggestions about how to make dungeons and other encounters more fun, most of which were done eons ago in EverQuest. 

SOE's working on a new EverQuest, EverQuest Next. They could do far worse than to go back to basics and try to capture what made EQ special for its time. EQ has changed so much now that it's a different game, but back then.... and as someone who last year started over from scratch, I can avow that EQ still has that same magic, if you're doing it with a group of friends. EQ nostalgia must be going around, because [Rao has got it as bad as I do](http://raoworld.wordpress.com/2009/09/22/chill-in-the-air/). I don't see either of us jumping back into the game, though.

[Werit reports](http://www.weritsblog.com/2009/09/sto-has-pvp-leveling.html) that [you'll be able to level up entirely via PvP](http://www.startrekonline.com/node/397) in Cryptic's upcoming Star Trek Online, which, I hope, will have a longer shelf life than Champions Online apparently had (I kid, I'm sure it's doing amazingly). Well, according to XFire, [Champions looks like it has already peaked](http://www.xfire.com/games/champions/Champions_Online/). But I don't trust those numbers. For one thing, we KNOW [the Aion numbers are inflated](http://www.xfire.com/games/aion/Aion_The_Tower_of_Eternity/) because so many people are never logging off.

Melmoth and Zoso of Killed in a Smiling Accident have just gotten word that many [other MMO companies are planning their own versions of WoW's Cataclysm](http://www.kiasa.org/2009/09/22/whats-the-collective-noun-for-cataclysms/). My favorite: Darkfall's UBACLASYM! It's IMPACTED!

Openedge1 [takes the pulse of a as-yet un-Cataclysmed Age of Conan](http://simple-n-complex.blogspot.com/2009/09/age-of-conan-commentary-of-end-of-year.html) to see if it will merely last the winter or if it has a long future ahead of it.

And lastly, F2P impresario Warhammermer writes about [Ran Online](http://www.ran-world.com/GameInfo/Features.aspx), a "[beat em up MMORPG set in a high school/secondary school](http://exploringwar.wordpress.com/2009/09/22/ran-online-high-school-beat-em-up/)".

I don't know why that reminds me of Pirate Baby's Cabana, but it does.
