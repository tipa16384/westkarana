# Rock Band: Finally, an album to download.

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-03-25 21:55:40*

Rock Band's first complete album download is not... Nevermind or Who's Next, as we'd been told. It's Boston's first album, Boston, which has pretty damn near all the best songs they ever did (I like "Cool the Engines" and "Amanda" off their third...)

Did I buy it? Um yeah kinda immediately. Back in high school, I loved Boston with a passion matched only by my severe, unrequited longing for Mike Oldfield. But unlike Mike, I never got to see Boston live.

We were just another band out of Boston...
