# World's Smallest Political Quiz

Take this quiz: [World's Smallest Political Quiz](http://tinyurl.com/wqo2). Not sure what the real point of it is; it calls me a liberal. Like, I didn't know that. But if you don't know if you're red, blue, or some sort of weird purple, it might be useful to you. Honestly, I'm surprised I didn't fall more into the Libertarian camp.
