I spent a few nights last week getting my Myth wizard, Tara Mythcrafter, through Grizzleheim so she could enter Wintertusk. She was already max level when Grizzleheim came out, and it just made more sense to put my alt team through, as they could use the experience and loot. When Wintertusk was released and I found it required Grizzleheim, I was at a loss.

Nothing for it but to rush through from showing my bravery to bears to destroying the coven -- twice. I'd missed a necessary update the first time through. It wasn't tough, though -- a level 60 balance wizard and a level 60 life wizard have little to fear from some old crows.

Imagine my surprise when, in Wintertusk, that same team was almost wiped out by three "trash" frost goblins. I officially hate Tower spells, when monsters play them, anyway.

So, here are the Norns. Ravens here, but in myth, they represented the divine force of women. [From the sacred Eddas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norns):


> 12. "Tell me then, Fafnir,
for wise thou art famed,
And much thou knowest now:
Who are the Norns
who are helpful in need,
And the babe from the mother bring?"

Fafnir spake:
13. "Of many births
the Norns must be,
Nor one in race they were;
Some to gods, others
to elves are kin,
And Dvalin's daughters some."



So they might as well be ravens as anything else. Note that some of the Norns were kin to Dvalin, that is to say, dwarfs. Note that Tolkein stole Dvalin from the Eddas, named him Dwalin, and inserted him into The Hobbit. These old Norse songs and legends are the truth source of Middle-Earth. Tolkein himself was a scholar of the old Norse legends, and never made a secret of the source of his stories. The One Ring itself was based on old legends that were woven into an epic opera of heroic fantasy, [Das Ring der Nibulengen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen), a fifteen hour work meant to be presented over four nights. The first night is a prelude. The next three nights are the trilogy. Tolkein happily followed suit in his Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.

So anyway, these particular raven Norns informed me that, as an outsider (an *Auslander*?), I am not part of the destiny they weave, so I can change the Fate that would cover the entire Spiral in ice once the evil ravens awaken the Ice Titan.

I was consumed by questions.


 * Shouldn't this be an Ice Jotun from Jotunheim?

 * Now that Wintertusk is inviting wizards in, does this mean the Fate they weave is pretty much destroyed forever now?

 * If Norns traditionally were midwives that helped women birth their children, what role do they have in a race that lays eggs?

 * Why do the raven Norns have breasts?

 * If they are weaving Fate, why can't they just weave the Ice Titan's defeat?

 * Why can't these Norns just do the tasks themselves?




I ask too many questions. But... I am on a quest for answers! One thing's for sure, though. I bet I'll be meeting the Ice Titan in battle at some point.

And it's for damn sure that I won't be getting any help from Ambrose or the other master wizards at Ravenwood. That Ambrose fella even informed me that even though I would be saving the world -- ALL the worlds -- I shouldn't expect to get a pass on any schoolwork.

Forget that. When I save Wintertusk, I'm going back to Dragonspyre and re-opening the Dragonspyre Academy. Our motto: More saving the world. Less homework.
