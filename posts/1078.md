#Slow Glass#

Researches in Surrey, England, have discovered [how to slow light down](http://portal.surrey.ac.uk/press/1107/151107) and trap it in glass. I was immediately reminded of a story by one of the great Irish science fiction writers, [Bob Shaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Shaw), in his "Light of Other Days"; Slow Glass was glass that took months or years to pass light from one side to the other, and he crafted that idea into a short story of heartbreak and loss.

SciFi.com has the [entire short story here](http://www.scifi.com/scifiction/classics/classics_archive/shaw/shaw1.html)... I've loved it since the first time I read it.
