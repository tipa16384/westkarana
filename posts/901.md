# EQ2: Fashion Challenged

I didn't *really* want to wear a bathrobe everywhere. What I wanted were some clothes that said -- hey! I'm a bard! Let's have a sing-a-long!

I needed some clothes nobody else would wear... and they had to look distinctive. I found a couple pieces of various trash sets -- 'woven engraved' (all lower case) looked unique, but I could only find the tunic. Being a tailor, I thought I might have something cool in my book of patterns... and the tunic from the set you get by killing the Chamberlain in the Nest jumped out at me. I'd never seen ANYONE wear it. And look, matching pants... and gloves!

![dinabust.jpg](http://westkarana.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/dinabust.jpg)I grabbed the parts I needed from the broker (they were surprisingly cheap), got some mythic filaments from the supplier (surprisingly pricey!) and headed up to Barren Sky to weave them together.

The recipes were levels 65 and 66. I am (was) a level 46 tailor.

This was going to be fun...

Now, I also have a 70 jeweler; I know how to make things pristine every time, and I knew I could do it here.... though it might take me a long time.

The tunic took ten minutes. The legs took almost fifteen! But I dinged 47 on them, and by contrast, the gloves only took about five minutes to make.

Tunic, gloves and pants don't make a complete set, so I took the purple leather shoulders from the tier 4 or 5 monk set and some boots that kinda matched from the broker... beauty.

The perfect bard set!

Tobold had a great discussion of the [differences between the various crafting systems](http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2007/09/comparing-crafting-systems.html) a few days ago, and in the end, he was favoring EQ2's... and I have to agree. In EQ2, I can scribe some recipes beyond my level, like these that were twenty beyond what I could do. In WoW, I'd be unable to make it, and that would be that. But in EQ2, I can give it a shot, and it will be hard and take a very long time (fifteen minutes is quite a long time to be spending in front of a loom, trying to keep durability from tanking while also babysitting the progress bar) -- but it will let me try, because skill with crafting counts. I did fail the first time; I didn't have the crafting actions set correctly (quest tailoring uses the Binding skill instead of the Tailoring skill), but once I took time to figure out what I was doing, it was all good and the next half hour was spent making three things, while the Hooluk battled the Vultaks at the door to the room, and the owl-people warned me to leave while I could, as they could not guarantee my safety should the Vultak break through.
