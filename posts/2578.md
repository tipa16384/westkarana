Hey we're gonna quickly run, quickly run
From the entrance to your lair, Nexona
Have us a bit of scaly fun, scaly fun
We're coming so beware, Nexona
Buff 'em up, get a coup- ple of mana sticks
Swap your gear, stand right here, sing arcane resists
My, aye, aye, aye, aye Woo!
Ma ma ma my Nexona
Ma ma ma my Nexona

In a cubby, lizard sacrifice, tastes real nice,
give you a little bit of heal, Nexona
if we hadn't paid the price, killed them twice
made you go without a meal, Nexona
Shiny in the hall, comes the call, and we deal with it
Now a drake which is take- ing the raid with it
Damn, damn, damn, damn damn Noo!
Ma ma ma my Nexona
Ma ma ma my Nexona
