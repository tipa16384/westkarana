#The peasants are begging for Spellborn? Let them kill bunnies!#

Frogster released yesterday a new Spellborn-based web mini-game. It's region free, so anyone in the world can play it... and since our Acclaim beta is a week overdue (raise your hand if you're surprised. What, no hands?), this is about the best we can do to sate the Spellborn craving...

I dunno if this will work on my blog, but it might! You can also play it at its [official home](http://spellborn.frogster-ip.com/hoppy/#) if you like.
