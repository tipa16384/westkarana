# EQ2: Shard of Fear

Went in, started, worked through and finished the Shard of Fear last night with an almost all-guild group. My son, who's been to SoF many times but never finished, vowed never to again go with a pick-up group.





Just for fun, I ran Fraps in SoF and took the occasional short clip; here's about a minute of various things in the zone. I wanted to edit the movies together in Cinellara under Linux, but I couldn't find a decoder that would take me from a Fraps 4-encoded movie to a Quicktime-encoded movie for Cinellara. So I used the Windows Movie Maker that came with Vista. It was pretty good, actually.

Insanely fun zone; it's great to revisit the old Plane of Fear and tear through it with a great group. I won a necklace that takes 5% of my life to give me 10% more damage to my special attacks and spells. Maybe I'll finally start making parses!

Didn't get my BOC axe. Maybe next time...
