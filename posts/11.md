#Fantasy Links#

Here's a nice definitions of the different [Fantasy Sub-Genres](http://www.fictionfactor.com/articles/fsubgenre.html).



Lord of the Rings is an obvious influence on EverQuest. I would count [The Worm Ouroborous](http://www.sfsite.com/07b/wo85.htm) by E. R. Eddison a perfect example of the influences that led to Warcraft.



A very nice look into [the people behind the avatars](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/05/technology_online_gamers_unmasked/html/1.stm) in Asian gaming.
