# EQ2: Bristlebane's Day and Battlegrounds

There was no way I was going to miss Bristlebane's Day on EverQuest II! Bristlebane and I have always had a special relationship. He was my deity in EverQuest and remains so in EQ2; as the creator of the halfling race, how could he not? Though others may claim Brell had a hand in our creation, we know better.

The April 1-only quest largely involved answering riddles by running to obscure corners of the globe looking for such things as a pack of cards, a map, an egg.... The sphinx who asked these riddles in the Enchanted Lands wouldn't just let you answer the riddle with words. Silly thing. And a kind of creature that seemed to be having seizures; people were so crowded around her, and every time someone spoke to her, she would spin toward them and bow in their direction. That made attempting to click on word balloons that constantly jumped all over the screen a not-so-fun mini-game of its own. The quest gave the Stone of Gygax, the large 20-sided die in the screenshot above, and who WOULDN'T want such a nice thing in their house?

While finishing the dodecahedron quest, I just had to stop and harvest a lot of the special bushes containing items for the Bristlebane Day crafting. With those I made most everything you see in the above picture as well :) I love EQ2 for its holiday crafting. I also made some of the motley robes for later.

Kinkle invited me to come along on a battlegrounds run. He lives for battlegrounds, and he'd gotten me excited about trying them and I was eager to try them out for myself.

It was... a rush. Everyone's level was normalized down to 80. It was a capture-the-flag scenario very similar to WoW's Warsong Gulch, with many of the same strategies, but it seemed far faster-paced. I was trying to determine the bard's role in a group. Sure, there's my buffs, but what else could I offer? Melee is as useless in EQ2 battlegrounds as in WoW's, but troubadours do have other tools at their disposals. I was proudest of keeping a healer mezzed until they could be killed. I wasn't sure if charming had any effect, but when I could find an enemy that was distracted with someone else, I could debuff them and snare them until they were easy pickings for a dps.

Most of the time, though, when someone really wanted to kill me, I'd be dead. There was one ranger in particular that made it his mission to kill me whenever he saw me.

Still, a lot of fun! And the battleground itself is just gorgeous.
