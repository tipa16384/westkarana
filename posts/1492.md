# Rabbyt, a Python-based sprite animation system

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-03-27 09:52:17*

Came across this [Python sprite package, Rabbyt](http://matthewmarshall.org/projects/rabbyt/) while looking for Python gaming development sites with [searchme](http://beta.searchme.com).

The current game I'm writing (when time permits) doesn't use sprites, but some tech demos I wrote do, and this looks like a pretty darn amazing package, able to do rotation and scaling and handle thousands of moving objects and collisions at incredible speed. My PyGame-based tech demos were struggling to get 60fps out of just forty or so sprites -- and I wasn't even testing collisions (well, they were supposed to be avoiding each other anyway). So I may have to revisit those demos and maybe there will be a game in there, after all.

I'll leave the difficulty of distributing a Python-based game in this era of Flash-based browser games for another time.
