#Live in North America? Want to play Spellborn? No problem!#

[Here's the link](http://www.amazon.de/Frogster-Interactive-Pictures-Chronicles-Spellborn/dp/B001KEMGI4/ref=sr_1_1/276-5856627-6539238?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1227105818&sr=8-1) for Chronicles of Spellborn, Premium Edition from Amazon Europe for 39,95 Euros. Here's the link for [Chronicles of Spellborn](http://www.amazon.de/Frogster-Interactive-Pictures-Chronicles-Spellborn/dp/B001KEMGHU/ref=sr_1_2/276-5856627-6539238?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1227105818&sr=8-2), just the game, for 14,95 Euros.

Just play on the European servers. As far as I know, English will be one of the Euro version's supported languages. If they don't take money from a US address, well, the Euro version of the game will supposedly have the same free starting zones, so:

For 39,95 Euros ($50.44 at today's exchange rate) plus the cost of international shipping, you could get a collector's edition that will probably not be available outside Europe, two free zones to play in assuming you don't get into the Acclaim 'closed beta', and the likelihood you'll be able to play in a far more active and vibrant community than will develop in the US.

Besides, playing as an American in a European game is fun. I've been in a couple of European guilds in EQ. You get caught up in soccer and Eurovision. You get to practice your German and French (and they get to practice their English, which is usually better than that of most native speakers, sadly). Huh? Could be fun, right?
