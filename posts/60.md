# Dryroot

New flag for Dryroot. The Wheel represents Dryroot's nomadic roots. The chocobo represents lunch. The green represents the grasslands through which we roamed, before Dryroot became a barren, inhospitable landscape.

Dryroot has an Upper and a Lower Parliament. The Prime Minister, Tarena Schlosschild, addressed the Upper Parliament this morning. I'll have a transcript up later.

The "Anti-Government Hour" is really a big hit among radio listeners, and has improved Dryroot's political freedom index...
