# Assault on the Inbox

Another week, another truckload of gaming press releases.

![](../uploads/2010/05/assault-479x185.jpg "Assault on the Inbox")

**Bioware announces their new downloadable content** for their Dragon Age RPG, "[The Darkspawn Chronicles](http://ebm.em.ea.com/c/tag/hBL9u3eB7uauvB8JggvDpF6Br5a/doc.html)". Meant as an alternate story -- one where your character from Dragon Age: Origins and Awakening dies during the Grey Warden initiation -- here you command the forces of the Darkspawn against the remnants of the forces of Light, led by the man who wouldn't be king, Alistair.

Complete the module, unlock an item in the main games. And hey, you can buy some replica swords with which to terrorize your friends, family and co-workers. THAT won't get you arrested. Perfect for slaying any stray Darkspawn you happen to meet on the bus.

**Jolt Online announces a new toolbar** for their Legends of Zork browser game. The toolbar will let you [keep track of your character](http://joltonlinegaming.createsend.com/T/ViewEmail/r/65929912D29C0407/5C9A30E8397DAF18D9767B6002735221) when you aren't playing the game, but are in your browser (IE and FF only, folks. Sorry, Safari and Chrome users) where... you could just load the game up if you wanted to see this information. I wondered idly on Twitter if this apparently useless add-on had some nefarious purpose. And I got a reply!

We already have covert viruses for that...[less than a minute ago](http://twitter.com/joltonline/status/14433765400 "Fri May 21 15:08:51 +0000 2010") via [TweetDeck](http://www.tweetdeck.com)[![](http://a1.twimg.com/profile_images/733688232/jolt-avatar_normal.jpg)](http://twitter.com/joltonline)**[Jolt Online Gaming](http://twitter.com/joltonline)**

@JoltOnline went on to explain:


> We get happier players, and happier players are more likely to keep playing our game (and buying stuff). It's that simple :P




If you're a Legends of Zork player, and want to [install this toolbar](http://joltonlinegaming.createsend.com/t/r/l/nfltd/iulrdhhhk/y), well, Jolt will give you 60 extra action points per character on your account. My gameplay these days is pretty much limited to seeing how my Accountant sidekick is doing with my stash.

I found out that there was ALSO a [toolbar for XFire](http://www.xfire.com/cms/about_xo/) that can detect you playing browser games, but it only works in IE, so sorry everyone who prefers another browser. It also optionally loads plugins, like music players and stuff, which you likely don't need. I use Chrome, so toolbar authors hate me. Or something.

**Swords and ships MMO Florensia** wants us to know about all their [new and fancy outfits](http://email.florensia-online.com/HM?a=DNX7CkBc6z0v8SA9MOOQOoDnGHxKR8L23g7s). Outfits are nice, but I always liked the sea game better than the rather standard land game.

**I doubt I need to mention** EverQuest II's [new $25 mounts](http://eq2players.station.sony.com/news/read/current/3556). The uproar has been amazing, especially since Blizzard's own quarter Benjamin horsey of last month was hailed by millions as manna from heaven. Fools and their money are soon parted and all that. Can't use the cash cats in most dungeons and on most raids. I wonder if they can be used in the battlegrounds? Anyway, if you have a fin and a couple sawbucks to spare, here's a place to spend it.

I think everyone should only refer to money with slang. I'll go first.

**KingsIsle uncovers another shadowy figure** from their forthcoming Wizard101 expansion, Celestia. The huge crab, dressed in shell armor and carrying a wicked polearm, looks menacing enough. If Celestia continues the trend of new Wizard101 worlds, we'll have to kill approximately a million of these critters at half an hour per fight.

Dragonspyre is SO TEDIOUS.

Anyway, that's all the barely relevant stuff from this last week. If you're a game developer and want to send me press releases, please do! I love getting mail!
