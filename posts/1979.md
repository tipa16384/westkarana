# PS3: LittleBig Planet in stores October 21

While I sit and stew because I can't play Rock Band 2 on my PS3 yet, news comes that LittleBig Planet, the multi-player platformer where building your own levels is part of the game, will be out in less than a month.

It's a game that, like Spore, runs on player creativity. Good stuff :) I'll definitely be checking it out.

They have some early adopter rewards -- you can see those and get more detail at [the writeup on Wired.com](http://blog.wired.com/games/2008/09/little-big-plan.html).

(Oh yeah -- Rock Band 2 for the PS3 is supposedly out October 19, so, busy week that week.)
