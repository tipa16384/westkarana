# Am I Witchy Enough For You?

*Posted by Tipa on 2020-05-19 11:06:56*


Since I finished Octopath Traveler a few weeks ago, I've been looking for another really decent RPG in which to lose myself. My boyfriend had several suggestions: Persona 4, DragonQuest XI, or the Witcher 3.



Now I've seen the Netflix series, so I kinda know the characters. When there were still places called \"libraries\" that people could go to, I'd borrowed the \"Blood of Elves\" Witcher book, which takes place after the events in the Netflix series.



So it was with that in mind that I started looking into getting it for the Nintendo Switch. But the Switch tax had that as expensive as any new game. For the PlayStation 4, though, it was super cheap, and I almost bought it for that...



But then my bf mentioned that the version on Steam let you swap in Henry Cavill's face for Geralt's face in the game. I shrugged. Then he said he'd been looking into it... and in the Steam version, you can mod it so that you can toss a coin to your Witcher.





Well.



It was still more money than I'd wanted to pay for it, so I put it on my wish list so I'd know when it went on sale. And it went on sale last night -- fifteen bucks for the base game and its two expansion.



It's downloading now.



This is not really great timing for me. I'm about midway through Chocobo Mystery Dungeon: Every Buddy!, a game I really do want to finish. I'm also spending a lot of time online with my EverQuest TLP trial run (I spent most of yesterday evening camping skeletons for quest armor bits while playing Chocobo Mystery Dungeon on the PS4). The *actual* EQ restart is coming up a week from tomorrow, and I'll need to spend a couple hours a night there.



I don't know when I'm going to be able to fit Geralt into my busy gaming schedule...

In other news, [Hero Forge](\"https://www.heroforge.com/\") reprinted my entire order after I submitted a ticket about H'aanit's arrow arriving broken the first time. Now I have doubles of the crew. I kinda sorta want to get involved into a D&D campaign where I can *play* with these miniatures! They really are begging to go up against ghouls, ghosts, goblins and other monsters that begin with \"g\".

Disclaimer: I've never finished so have no idea how long it actually takes. Howlongtobeat says 191 hours for the \"Completionist\" track for the base game and DLC.

I really did try to finish it the last time I played but jumpin jeebus it just goes on and on. I eventually drifted away, after like 30-40 hours when I still felt like I was at the start of the story. 

I think the only reasonable way to play it is just to focus on the main story quests.

I really had no interest in it until I watched the Netflix series and understood the basic storyline. When it came out, I guess I asked myself if I wanted to play an aging warrior and answered \"no\". But now... well, we'll see.

I have ~110 hours in The Witcher 3 -- I wouldn't call that a completionist run, but I got what is (arguably) the best ending of the main game and completed the first expansion.

I'm only about midway through the second, larger expansion though... I really must get back to it some day. I still have it installed even.
