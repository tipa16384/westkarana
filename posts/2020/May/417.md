# Makin' Friends with the Fiends

![\"\"](\"https://chasingdings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/chocobomystery.gif\")I mostly wanted to see if I could pull an animated GIF off the PS4...

I posted last week or so ago that I liked Chocobo Mystery Dungeon: Every Buddy! as a sort of light RPG that I could enjoy while waiting for something better to come along. That something better came in the form of Witcher 3, which is downloaded -- all 40+ gigabytes of it -- and waiting for me to play.



But CMD:EB has become more of an obsession for me. I stumbled into the realization that you could actually befriend the boss monsters that you have defeated, using the mirrors in the cathedral to replay old dungeons. Defeat the boss four more times after the first time, and they will come with you and put the fear of divine wrath into whatever you face.



Chocobo and Ifrit are looking hungrily at that Master Tonberry there. Tonberry just remembered he wasn't even supposed to be working today. Bwaha.



Now I have to collect them all. I think my next target is going to be Behemoth. That S.O.B. blocked me so hard on level 10 of the Tower of Light -- meteors on the first turn? Unpossible! While leveling up the Beastmaster job, though, I saw that I'd acquired the Shell and Protect spells, and neutered him with those while I and my white mage friend did unmentionable things to him. Defeat him four more times, and he's mine.



Still stuck on the dungeon of Insatiable Hunger. It's open for me on easy mode right now -- a mere fifty levels. Once I get through that, then the actual dungeon opens -- it's endless. After the first ***500*** floors, it simply repeats. 



I need to level up the jobs I've been ignoring (Freelancer, Scholar and White Mage so far) to see what they offer. It might be better to be healing a 'buddy' and keeping them alive than to have them try to keep me alive, and drawing aggro from it.
