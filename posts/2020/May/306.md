# MMO updates: Crowfall, EverQuest, Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon, DCUO

I apologize for the brief news on Crowfall. I'd meant to get deeper into the PvE, but while I was building up my kingdom in the creative mode, the test server came down and I moved on to other things.



It's been years since Chinese publishers ChangYou took over the Shadowbane IP, and eight or so since they released plans to relaunch it. Now, here in 2020, [it looks like they are finally really relaunching](\"http://bbs.shadowbane.com/portal.php\") the famed empire building, PvP MMO. Shadowbane was notable for the huge number of beast races available for play, as well as the EVE-like way armies could gather to siege or defend player-created cities.



Competing against the original Shadowbane would be new MMO [Crowfall](\"https://crowfall.com/en-US/\"), developed by [many of the same people](\"https://crowfall.com/en-US/team\") who developed the original Shadowbane (with a pit stop into kids games like [Wizard101](\"https://www.wizard101.com/\") along the way).



Like Shadowbane, players can choose from beast races such as Minotaur and Centaurs as well as standard fantasy races like elves and... hamsters?



I'll be writing more of Crowfall as I get further into it.



EverQuest
---------



My BF unexpectedly asked if I'd be interested in starting over in EverQuest in one of the new progression servers last night. He's interested in playing evil races, and we're kinda tentatively thinking about starting on the [Aradune True Box time-limited progression servers when they come up in a few weeks](\"https://www.everquest.com/news/anniversary-21-overseer-xp-march-2020\").



(True Box servers do not allow boxing; they will also at the same time be bringing up a new server where multi-boxing is encouraged and expected).



I patched up my copy of EverQuest and created a new character in the previous True Box TLP server, Mangler, just to see what was up, and everything worked fine. I said hello to my old characters, including Ramona, my ranger from Nostalgia The Guild, the last time I started from scratch in EQ. I haven't seriously played my legacy characters since the Underfoot expansion, so it's been awhile either way.



Thoughts are that BF would play an evil shaman of some sort (and if we start on Aradune, that means Ogre or Troll). I'd probably end up playing a Dark Elf Shadowknight. Someone needs to have snare.



DCUO
----



Not much to report, really. Slowly building out the Volcano Lair I got from the Lex Luthor tower solo feat. Found some Thanagarian spacecraft that really spiff up the place. Combat rating up to 301, so only a little bit below the curve. I thought I'd gotten the feat about not using any consumables or supercharge abilities on the solo run last night, but I guess I must have done one or the other accidentally. The Swamp Thing event is winding down; can't really say there's any rewards from it that I want.



Super close to doing a breakthrough on my Birds of Prey augment, just need one more rare drop from the solo. The leveling of my precision artifact goes slowly. I have a lot more DPS gated behind that thing.



Chocobo Mystery Dungeon
-----------------------



This isn't an MMO :-) This is just me jonesing hard for a quick [roguelike](\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike\"). I'd played *Pokemon* Mystery Dungeon back in the day, and this is more or less the same game.



The story is, you (a chocobo) and your friend Cid are looking for a power source for Cid's new airship. While investigating a tower in the sand, you, Cid, and a rival treasure hunter are pulled into a world where everyone loses their memories at the end of each day, the city of Lostime.



Your job is to enter their spirit realms (which are randomized dungeons) and restore their memories and eventually take on and defeat the witch that controls the Oblivion Bell that does the nightly memory robbing.



I was going to buy [Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon: Everybuddy!](\"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/chocobos-mystery-dungeon-every-buddy-switch/\") on the Switch, but I'd have had to pay the [Switch Tax](\"http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/08/is_switch_tax_a_real_concern_or_just_a_myth\"). I bought it instead on the PS4 and have been having a fun time with it.



More on these games as I get deeper into them :)
