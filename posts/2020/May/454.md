# Octomini Project Day 2: Primed and Ready

*Posted by Tipa on 2020-05-28 03:27:17*


I'd really wanted to talk about playing in the new EverQuest server today. I took a day off from work to play EverQuest and watch the SpaceX rocket take off with two American astronauts from American soil.



Neither happened. I guess the weather just wasn't quite right for either.



It wasn't a total loss. It was still nice to spend an unexpected day with my boyfriend. We went to the local game store, which opened early for us. We were the only ones there. I bought a very small paint brush and a couple vials of paint; Kasul bought a couple of discount games. The person working there didn't know when they'd be running Friday Night Magic again. We were all of us wearing masks. I bought an Ikoria bundle just for fun.



Afterward we went to Five Guys for lunch. Their deal is you order online, then drive there. When you get there, you press a button on their web page saying you're there, and they bring the food out to you.



It's all so very weird. I think it might become the new normal, though.



Since EQ wasn't happening, I primed my two Hero Forge minis for painting. I also grabbed one of my Gloomhaven minis, the Cragheart, to paint.



With all three of them primed, it's easy to see the clear difference between the molded mini, on the left, and the two 3D printed minis, center and right. Obvious layer lines. 



But more than that, the Cragheart will just be easier to paint. There are no hidden surfaces; everything is easy to get to. Olberic and especially Primrose have all sorts of interior surfaces that are going to be a real challenge. While priming, I started working on a strategy for those.



And, while the minis are super easy to see here in this photo, in real life they are super small. I'm not sure I'll even be able to see the mini's detail while I'm painting it. My eyesight is pretty bad, after all.



But I've started down the road, I'll see where it takes me. At least I can always have [Hero Forge](\"https://www.heroforge.com/\") print me the colored versions now :-)

Since I couldn't create a character in EverQuest last night (and still can't get in this morning), I went to Hero Forge and created my artist's rendition of Kanad (Troll Shaman) and Nashuya (Dark Elf Shadow Knight) taking the fight to the login queue. May they be ever victorious.
