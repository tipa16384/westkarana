# Five Reasons You're Playing EverQuest Wrong (and Five Ways You're Crushing EQ!)

*Posted by Tipa on 2020-05-23 11:07:36*


Is this a bad post title? I'm really working on making engaging content, and I'm told it all begins with a great thumbnail and a killer title. I heard that the best way to get a response on the internet is to tell someone they're doing something wrong, so...



This post isn't about clickbait headlines, I promise!



Our ramp up to the new Time Limited Progression (TLP) servers continue. Kasul and I both downloaded the latest maps, so those are ready. Kasul also made a new troll shaman and ran him over to Nektulos Forest, where we plan to meet up and XP as a shadow knight/shaman duo. 



Next step was to upgrade my user interface. Kasul has like a 40 inch screen on his desk, and his UI is spread over a lot of screen real estate. My screens are quite a bit smaller.



I browsed [EQ Interface](\"https://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?s=a35f15f1ef2132b56f2e2b766ab64acb&id=5518\") and eventually settled on the AYA UI. I dimly remember this or something like it from the olden days when once I played. I might have used it, I might not have. I think, back then, I preferred the old [T.King-style user interfaces](\"https://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=3211\"). (Tom King [was hired by Sigil Games](\"https://www.gamezone.com/news/sigil_games_grows_again_hires_four_new_artists/\") to work on the Vanguard UI based on his work on EverQuest user interfaces! Unfortunately, Sigil wasn't able to work with [Tom's need to work remotely](\"http://www.vginterface.com/forums/printthread_t_16.html\"), and they parted ways.)

This is a picture you won't be seeing from me once we start on Aradune. No Plane of Knowledge, no newbie armor, no Field of Bone shield, I dunno where those claws come from but none of them neither.



One thing I will have, though, is a forty slot bag with 100% weight reduction.



EverQuest went free to play awhile ago. I'm not sure what the restrictions, if any, are for FTP players (I know you have to subscribe in order to play on the TLP servers at least), but every FTP game can be counted upon to have a cash shop. EQ has a cash shop. And in that cash shop, they sell a USD$20 bundle that gives you a 40 slot bag, and the items in that bag have no weight.



In my trial run, I couldn't help notice that my SK spent most of her time overburdened. Eventually gear will remove all weight issues, but now... just a few minutes at any camp, and I can barely move anywhere.



I was soloing a skelly camp in Nektulos for quest armor pieces. (I spent many nights doing this.) A three-box came up and asked why I, who could no longer get decent xp from that camp, were there. I explained about the newbie armor pieces. When I got up to take care of a skelly spawn, they asked why I was walking so slow.



\"Roleplaying!\"



They seemed dubious. I explained that I was just overburdened from looting so many rusty weapons. Eventually I looted so much that I couldn't move at all. I used the new \"Origin\" command to return to my home city, placing me in front of my guildmaster. I dropped a few weapons so I could make my slow way to the vendor to sell, then came back, picked up the weapons and sold them, too.



This long camp isn't all bad. I'm up over 50 plat now and I've taken up baking.



Baking is the other thing I'm trialing. I should probably take up brewing as well. There are raids where it is important to have high alcohol tolerance and I am not even kidding.



Just a few more days, now. Kasul and I have both taken the day off from work. Should be epic!
