# Game Log for June

*Posted by Tipa on 2020-07-01 12:35:25*


June hasn't been the best month for gaming. Tom and I are ramping up our 3D printing, and working on that sort of stuff is taking more and more of our time. I hope it's worth it. I have a severe backlog of minis to paint -- I have to finish the Gloomhaven PC minis, I have an army of vermlings and cultists to paint for the first few Jaws of the Lions scenarios, some snakes... Plus printing the terrain tiles.



Chocobo Mystery Dungeon Every Buddy (PS4)
-----------------------------------------



This has become my go-to game when I only have a few minutes to play. It's easy drop in and drop out gaming, and so, weirdly, it's the game I have been playing most often lately. I'm currently in the Dark Dungeon, which, I believe, is the final story dungeon (although there may be one more to wrap up Croma's story). After that is the end-game, where the challenge becomes brutal. I think it's safe to say that everything up to that point is just an extended opening story :-)

Death Stranding
---------------



I didn't actually play Death Stranding last month. I came across some of the old screenshots while getting the Chocobo screenshots off the PS4 and got nostalgic. I really liked Death Stranding.

Gloomhaven: The Video Game
--------------------------



It really can't be any surprise that I am playing the digital version of my favorite board game. This recently went on sale on Steam, and though it is still early access, I just had to give it a chance. It is surprisingly fun, especially since the game does all the tedious work on setting up the dungeon, managing cards and decks, and moving the enemies for me.



If you have any interest in Gloomhaven, or are a player, it's worth getting.



That screenshot? That's what I'm trying to build in real life.

Final Fantasy XIV
-----------------



Here's a pro tip: If you ever try to play FFXIV on a new computer, *make sure your e-mail address is one you still have available.* I'd registered \"brendahol@gmail.com\" as my address back in the day, and since the domain was stolen from me, I no longer have access to that e-mail. 



It took like a week to get access back. But I did, and the game looks gorgeous on the new computer. I'd intended to move everything over to the new computer, but it turns out my old computer -- the one I'm using to type this post -- has more disk capacity (2 Tb vs 1 Tb), and the stuff I have here just won't fit over there. Right now I'm using it to stream games to *this* PC to take advantage of its nicer graphics card. Eventually I'll get another drive and then complete the transition. The new computer is a downgrade in some ways, I guess.



EverQuest
---------



I haven't been playing as much as I'd like. Our original plan was for Tom and I to create complementary characters and level up to experience the old world. He's spending most of his scarce free time between work and bedtime on 3D projects. I've been dong the occasional group on my mage in an effort to get her to a level for plains raids. My most recent group was a nostalgia-drenched Mistmoore group. All these classic grouping locations will disappear in a few weeks, so I feel a real urgency to experience them now before Kunark shakes things up.



Current levels:



* Nashuya Todesstrand (Shadow Knight) -- 26
* Dunkela Feuersturm (Magician) -- 35



I really enjoy both characters. I'd like to play them more often. But getting into a group in EverQuest forms a commitment to stay for awhile. And sometimes I don't want to make that commitment, so I don't play.



The Witcher 3
-------------



I got through the first few chapters of the game but haven't made any significant progress. Just a lack of time and too many games.
