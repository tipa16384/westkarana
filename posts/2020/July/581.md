# Game Night: Trogdor!! the Board Game

*Posted by Tipa on 2020-07-24 11:42:24*


Trogdor!  
Trogdor!  
Trogdor was a man  
I mean, he was a dragon man  
*Or maybe he was actually a board game*  
But he was still TROGDOR!

Burninating the countryside,  
Burninating the peasants,  
Burninating all the peoples  
And their thatched-roof cottages!  
THATCHED-ROOF COTTAGES!

Trogdor the Board Game is based on the iconic [Strongbad E-mail #58: Dragon](\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90X5NJleYJQ\"). You, and up to five of your dragon-drawing friends play as Keepers of Trogdor, members of a group that help Trogdor...



* Burninate the countryside
* Burninate all the peasants
* Burninate all the thatched-roof cottages



Each player in turn draws an action card (which provide action points and often some sort of special move for Trogdor), then uses those actions, their special item and their special Keeper abilities to move Trogdor and get to the burninating.



Each player, after their turn, plays the *board* turn, where randomly drawn movement cards potentially add more peasants to the board (decreasing Trogdor's health), and set knights, an archer, and potentially a deadly knight known only as Troghammer after Trogdor to end his burnination.



Each game is fairly short; we played through three times and won two and a half of the games. (We would have lost the second game, except we cheated. Drew's character was \"the cheater\", though, giving him the ability to cheat. After that, we exiled that card from the game...)



Super fun game, everyone was laughing the entire time. The tactical elements were a lot of fun to work through.



Since we finished early, we had a chance to choose characters for Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion. Ally went, as expected, for the Demolitionist. Drew surprisingly went for the Red Guard. Tom took the Hatchet, and I took the Voidwarden, whose move set was a lot more fun that I expected.



We start with Jaws of the Lion in two weeks.
