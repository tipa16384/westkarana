# Battle Bards Episode 167: Childlike wonder

![\"\"](\"https://biobreak.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kids-mmos.jpg?w=636&h=419\")


Tapping into their inner children, the three Battle Bards get into the spirit of name calling, trading stickers, and goofing off in kiddie MMOs. It’s another episode devoted to 100% kid-themed games and their soundtracks and the weird rabbit hole tangents that the hosts find themselves pursuing. Did you know Switzerland has a Not-Fun Zoo? Never, ever go there. Just trust us.
