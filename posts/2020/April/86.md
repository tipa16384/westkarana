# Octoplastic Traveler

*Posted by Tipa on 2020-04-21 04:03:40*


I've got 110 hours into Octopath Traveler on the Switch, and those hundred and ten don't like -- it's a fun game. Frustrating at times... I've been working on the true final ending for a couple of weeks now, slowly improving, getting a little bit further. Most of my characters are around level 70, but that final boss is TOUGH.



Sure, Reddit says you can beat that boss at level 35, but Reddit lies all the time.



A few months back, mini design and print site [Hero Forge](\"https://www.heroforge.com/\") [ran a Kickstarter](\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/heroforge/full-color-custom-miniatures-with-hero-forge-20\") to help them add color modeling and printing to their site. As a gamer who likes miniatures but hates *painting* miniatures, this was a must-back. I didn't know what I would need printed in color, but I knew I'd figure out something.



Finishing Octopath Traveler when the color tools went live was the perfect storm. I had to model the Travelers in plastic. And then print them.

I fell in love with them. That love lasted right up until I went to purchase them. Even with the Kickstarter reward of a \"free\" color mini, the total bill was north of $300. I picked my favorite four (H'aanit, Tressa, Ophilia and Olberic) and ordered just those. It was still a lot. They are not shipping before midsummer, but I can wait.



It's a great game. I don't know if it's my game of the year, since this year is also the year I played Death Stranding, Greedfall, the Nonary Game and Outer Wilds, among others. But it's good.



It'd be hard to top Death Stranding, to be honest. That game did something to my head. And Outer Wilds had me gibbering away in the kitchen during one stressful moment, but that's another story for another time.

...It's on the list though... for one of these days... sometime. ;)

AC has a daily rewards thing and it takes SO LONG to load that I go days just backgrounding it and so never playing Octopath. I don't even LIKE AC that much but PartPurple loves it so I play in solidarity with her. 

But OT gave me the JRPG itch and Tipa mentioned on Twitter that she'd enjoyed Bravely Default on 3DS, which at some point I'd purchased and not played, so I'm into that now.
