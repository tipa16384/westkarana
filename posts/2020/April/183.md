Last night: Started off with the dailies in DCUO. Kaptain KY had told me to fly left before the final fight to escape from Lobo's Space Hogg, and that worked. Spode had said there was a special achievement for waiting for Luthor's escape teleporter to recharge and then following it where it led, and I did.



And I fell right into my very own Volcanic Hideout.

So this is my new place now. Elon Musk, eat your heart out.



After that, I finished leveling all of my second team in Octopath Traveler to 70 or better. Today at lunch I took them through the eight bosses before the final boss in the game. I might try working my way through that tonight.



After I watched the rest of last Sunday's Westworld, I spent the rest of the night watching my BF play Persona 5 Royal. The game is off the edge of the map now and neither of us has any idea what's going to happen.



It's fun.
