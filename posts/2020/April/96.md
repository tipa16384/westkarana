# Ophilia is out for printing!

![\"\"](\"https://chasingdings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/OphiliaRendered.png\")The 3D printed characters should look a lot like this.

Hero Forge sent today the receipt for yesterday's order for the printed Octopath Traveler minatures. The lighting is a lot flatter than it is in the modeler, and I expect this will look more like the printed result than the modeler. Kind of that grainy feel I've seen in sintered pieces I've ordered from Shapeways before.



They'll be done in June sometime...
