# Follow up: Dungeon Siege with HD texture pack

I started replaying Dungeon Siege tonight... and man, I sure hope I don't end up replaying *all* of the games on my \"top five game series\" list. It'll take me years.



Anyway, I downloaded the HD textures pack, but I can't really tell if the graphics are really any higher resolution. They don't really look any better than I remember. The textures pack came with a note that the optional second campaign, Legends of Alana (I think?), needed to be installed before these files were installed. I didn't do that step. It's getting late; tomorrow I'll give that a shot.



Currently the highest resolution available is 1024x768, which is super small. It also forces full screen, and the screen ends up really stretched on a modern monitor. The screenshot above looks more or less normal, but it's stretched in game.



Playing this game once again after fifteen years or so, things bug me now that I probably wouldn't have even noticed. The camera is hard to keep focused on what you're fighting, as you either have to hit the edge of the screen with the cursor (forcing you to stop fighting), or use the arrow keys. For a right-handed person like myself, that means taking my hands off the mouse (and therefore no longer fighting) to adjust the screen.



I'd forgotten that spells and weapons were skill based -- you have to use them to gain skill in them. Right now, four paths present themselves: melee, ranged, nature magic and combat magic. I can gain skill in any of them by just using them. Right now I'm focusing on range and intend to give the other roles to other party members.



Just a short update. More later if I can get the graphics to improve.



**UPDATE!** Game hero Jeff Rimer comes through with the info on how to make the game look great on modern displays!




> From watching a video about the upgraded graphics there's not too much of a difference. That might be it though because the the tree looks pretty sharp. It also seems you have to edit an ini file to get 1080 resolution. [https://t.co/xZqJQTm6d8](\"https://t.co/xZqJQTm6d8\")
