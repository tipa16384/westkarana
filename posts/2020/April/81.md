![\"\"](\"https://chasingdings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lukako.png\")Practicing a lot and trying very hard.

Yeaaahhhhh I'm back, but I'm not telling anyone until I have some stuff to show. The old blog is backed up riiiight here. I think I might be able to import it all, given time. No reason I can't start blogging while I work on it.




What's happened in the past... several years? A lot. Waaaay too much to talk about all at once. Things will come up when they come up and we'll talk about it. I don't play MMOs as much as I used to, but I still game quite a lot. I have all sorts of quarantine stuff I'm working on -- and I guess this blog is one of those things.




I have put this web site on my Twitter bio for months now. If you're here from there, leave a comment or something :-)

Adding Chasing Dings to my blog roll to replace the much-missed West Karana. Very glad to hear you have it backed up. I should go do that myself...

**Tipa** writes: Oh yeah, I just double checked the other day -- those years of posts are safe. I have to figure out what sort of SQL wizardry I have to do to get it all up on this blog, but I'll get to it.

I just started up the blog, so you didn't miss anything :)

**Tipa** writes: Well, thank you :-) I hope to get my old content back up at some point. Nice to meet you, too!
