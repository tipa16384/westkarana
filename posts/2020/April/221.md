# LOTRO: O Captain, my new captain!

Sometimes when you have an itch, you scratch, even if it’s not the prudent thing to do.


I already have more than enough to do in LOTRO — one character at the level cap on the regular servers to handle new patch content and one character on the progression server trying to keep up with the expansion unlocks. With the new legendary server coming out this fall, chances are I’ll probably pop on that, too. So there’s no need to make another character. Yet I did.


I guess I just wanted a “mess around with no pressure” character. One that wasn’t trying to keep up with the rat race but could operate more freely and according to parameters that I, not the game, establish. So I figured that there was no harm in rolling up a new Captain to play a bit here and there on my lunch break.


But I really wanted this character to feel different than the others that I had, so I laid out some ground rules that I wanted to follow:


1. I am not going to rush this character. Doesn’t matter if I ever get through the game on her. The purpose is just to experience and take as much time as needed. I’m not going to be using the XP boosting items that are in my account.


2. Rather than leveling, my goals are zone deed achievements. Zone by zone, I want to clear out my deed logs. That’ll have the side benefit of generating some extra LOTRO points, although I don’t really need those. I haven’t decided on festival deeds or not; I might not have time in the short sessions I have to keep up with those.


3. Speaking of LP, the only thing I’m buying for this character out of the gate is the riding skill. Any other store unlocks have to come out of her “pocket” — that is, she has to earn the LP to spend the LP. I’m keeping track of how much she’s earning on a little card. I’ll probably aim at milestone cooldown reductions and additional milestones, since those are so handy.

4. I’m rolling on a new server (Arkenstone) to meet additional parts of the larger community and to have a home and wardrobe that isn’t shared but rather unique to this one character.


5. My captain is going yellow-line with a sword-and-shield, just for a change to how my old cappy played. I figure a Captain is going to be pretty robust and be more laid-back to play.


6. I’m going to forgo legendary items. I’m sure that’s going to gimp me, but I need to try it. I think I’m up for the challenge.


The first few days with her went pretty well. I got through the tutorial, set up a few outfits out of all of the account-wide unlocks I have, found a chatty little guild, and got to questin’ in Bree-land. I figure I’ll go through ALL of Bree-land first, get to level 20ish, and then backtrack to do Ered Luin and Shire deeds after.


I was a bit of an idiot on the third day, however, when I attacked a super-elite warg without thinking. When you’re a Captain, you kind of assume nothing can kill you. Well, this thing did, and since I was only level 10, that means I won’t get that level 20 undying title. Oh well, I almost never get that.
