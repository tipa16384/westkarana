# Sunday Serenade: Martika, Emmit Fenn, and more!

![\"\"](\"https://biobreak.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/music.jpg?w=636&h=358\")


Time for another Sunday morning dose of random songs that I’ve been listening to this past week! Welcome to Sunday Serenade — now let’s crank the jams up with…



**“I Feel the Earth Move” by Martika** — You never realize how much you need a strong shot of ’80s music until you get some and feel deeply satisfied.



**“Wicked Wonderland” by Martin Tungevaag** — If you can tolerate the sax as a primary chorus motivator, it’s a pretty bouncing track.



**“BuDuDuDum” by Emmit Fenn** — I think I found my new jam. Gonna play this once a day.



**“Revolting Children” from Matilda the Musical** — Never let it be said that Syp doesn’t love a good strong musical number!



**“Do Si Do” by Diplo** — Such an unusual sounding song, especially with the whispered/growl of the singer and the shamelessly western vibe, but man, it hooks you right in and doesn’t let go.



**“Pale Sun Rose” by Matthew and the Atlas** — This almost slipped beneath the waves of my interest, but something about it keep bouncing it to the surface. I could picture driving along, listening to this, so onto the playlist it goes!



**“Daydreams” by Meado** — I’m finding that I’m a complete sucker for great tropical tracks, and this one fits the bill perfectly.
