Octopath Traveler: Made it to the second phase of Galdera, the true final boss. This was my first time making it this far. Now that I've got the first phase understood, I just have to figure out how to get through this part before I can finally put the game away.



Part of the issue came after I killed his three living weapons: he covered his weaknesses except for a couple I couldn't break quickly. Then he swallowed all our boost points, spirit points, and health. I did my best but he killed half the team in one hit, and then the other half in the next hit.



So, partly bad luck. I think I will have to give up on using the 1HP Fortitude trick with Olberic. It's fast if it works, but deadly if it doesn't. However, I am now grinding a little and working on tuning the gear so that everyone becomes ready in the correct order. I also have to remember to cast Leg Hold on Galdera a lot.

Team Spode met in DCUO last night. Lord Spode's combat rating is up to 304; Kaptain KY's was at a solid 300. This is a guy whose work kept him busy almost every night until the pandemic locked us all in. So he spent his time working on his character. He and Spode got the top spots in all the instances we did last night; I came in consistently third. In a raid like the Fire and Brimstone raid, the final chapter in the Birds of Prey expansion, that's not a bad thing.



Plus, we got a chance to kill Jimmy Olsen. Made my heart leap with joy. The only way I could have been happier would be if he'd strapped Robin in front of him so they could have left this continuity together forever.



(Of course, Jimmy survived, regretting wearing a hijacked suit of Lex Luthor's power armor that Lex had zero trouble taking control of).

We afterward did the four player alert, where we fought this artificial person that Jimmy Olsen named \"Amazeballs\" (but instantly regretted it, calling him \"Amazo\" instead. I liked Amazeballs better).



This android can take on the powers of two members of the Justice League at once. At one point he took on the powers of Batman and some other hero. I don't even remember. I was just trying to remember what Batman's powers *were*.





My favorite, though, was when Amazo took on the powers of Superman and The Flash. The team begged me to stop trying to make \"THE SLASH!\" happen...



After the alert, the rando that joined the three of us begged to join the league.



Bwahahaha. You do not JOIN Team Spode. You are BORN into it.



Actually yeah anyone can join Team Spode if they're cool and like hanging out with middle-aged gamers on Discord.

One of the most annoying things in the whole ten years of Smallville was that Jimmy Olsen actually, really, died... and then right at the end they introduced his brother, who was indistinguishable. And both the brothers have James as one of their names so the \"Jimmy\" we knew for years and who was cathartically killed was never the \"real\" Jimmy Olsen to begin with!

Sometimes I hate comics.

There was even a Jimmy Olsen comic book way back when where he'd get into trouble and then use his Superman watch to get Supes to save him.

If I were Superman, I'd be feeling mighty used. And Supes in this alert says \"Jimmy Olsen's in trouble again? Must be a Tuesday.\".

He KNOWS.
