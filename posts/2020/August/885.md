# Blaugust #30: Don't Worry, Be Happy

*Posted by Tipa on 2020-08-31 07:35:16*


This is the last Blaugust Promptapalooza post for this year! It's my first one, and I really feel badly that I missed all the previous ones.



I loved some of the prompts, didn't like some of the others, and there were some I just couldn't think of anything to say. I learned a lot from reading others' posts and met some new friends -- yeah, I know that's cliche, but even cliches can be true.

The final writing prompt of Promptapalooza 2020 is from [the prompt master himself](\"https://aggronaut.com/\"), who surprisingly didn't (yet) write a post asking the question:




> What is your favorite thing to do in order to relax?

Well, I don't know but... I play video games to relax. Also, I watch movies, work on 3D printing, play tabletop games, bicycle, play my flutes and kalimbas, write -- pretty much every post in this blog is a story of me relaxing.



I don't talk about work much because I doubt anyone would be interested, and I'm not about to invade the personal privacy of the people I work with to talk about them on a blog. Plus, since I work for a company that is involved in financial matters, I literally can't talk in any sort of detail about exactly what it is I do. Aside from: I'm a web developer working primarily at the moment in writing back-end services for an [Angular](\"https://angular.io/\")/[Bootstrap](\"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/\") application. (Yes, I linked to Bootstrap 3 for a reason... we're not on Bootstrap 4 yet).



My most recent project was trying to figure out how to evict a cache of objects that have been dirtied by a separate application, meaning that the information in our cache is now obsolete. Surprise! Also, we don't have the keys for those objects because for some reason the [Spring Cache interface](\"https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/Cache.html\") doesn't expose a method for querying the contents of a cache. My boss suggested making a *new* cache that would just contain indices of objects in the *other* caches. Then consider that we might have multiple [OpenShift containers](\"https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform\") each with their *own* caches. I held out for the \"nuke all the caches from orbit, it's the only way to be sure\" approach.



![\"\"](\"https://chasingdings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0ac725a63d6d14aa2f2351a1e912127f.jpg\")I just remembered that Bill Paxton is dead. Rest in peace.

So you see, even if I *were* to talk about my work, it would be *dull*. Also, for those people who think that web development isn't real programming, well, it is.



One thing I've noticed during these prompts is that I end up writing the *opposite* of whatever the prompt is. Today I'm supposed to be writing about what I do to relax, and I ended up talking about work -- right after a full paragraph explaining why I shouldn't really be talking about work.



Just a sign of my worst personality trait, a wide contrarian streak.



What I really should be doing, instead of writing these blog posts each morning, is bicycling to work (a thing I do to relax). It takes me about an hour -- more if I use the trike instead of the bicycle, so writing these blogs is taking up my riding time. So this is my last morning post -- until the next writing event.



Thanks for the fun and the journey and the friends we made along the way :-)
