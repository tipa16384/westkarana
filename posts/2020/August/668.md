# A Look Back to Champions Online -- in Comic Form!

*Posted by Tipa on 2020-08-12 04:23:40*


I [read on Twitter today](\"https://twitter.com/wilhelm2451/status/1293218903728955393\") that Daybreak Games had bought out another studio, Cold Iron, [who are working on a game set in the Ridley Scott \"Alien\" universe](\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/08/11/daybreak-games-acquires-cold-iron-studios-saving-the-next-alien-game/\"). The developers had previously worked on City of Heroes, Champions Online and many other MMOs. That reminded me of a comic I made back when Champions Online was in beta... There seems no better time that to start picking up content from my old blog, West Karana. So here's a couple comics I made once.



Moonmist was my superhero character I played in the original Champions TTRPG a really long time ago. She had the power to phase through things in the TTRPG. She didn't get those powers in Champions Online.

After a few days passed, I thought there might be another story to tell in the Champions universe...

And, lastly, some salty tears from my main strip, Adventures in Monopoly...
