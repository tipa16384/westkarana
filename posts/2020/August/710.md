# Adventures in Monopoly: The Beginning

*Posted by Tipa on 2020-08-17 17:34:20*


A long, long time ago, I got a shiny metal bear in an EverQuest 2 expansion box. I kinda thought it looked like it could be a piece to a Monopoly game, so I took out my Monopoly board and played around with it a little... and the characters took on a life of their own.



I don't know what happened to Dire Bear. The rest of the crew are still in the Monopoly box, but I must have set Bear aside somewhere. I'll find him eventually, and maybe there'll be new stories for the crew to tell.



I knew nothing about making web comics back then, but the skills I eventually built doing this led to better things.

I don't even remember what \"let me see your tan\" was supposed to mean. I *think* I was referring to the color of the $100 bill in Monopoly.
