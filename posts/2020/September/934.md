# Adventures in Monopoly -- Darkfall, Part II

The first part to the comic in the header image was [over here](\"https://chasingdings.com/2020/08/24/adventures-in-monopoly-cash-shop/\"), and the second part was right [over there](\"https://chasingdings.com/2020/09/01/adventures-in-monopoly-darkfall-pt-1/\").



In this comic, I'd finally realized that poor lighting wasn't something I could fix in Picasa, and what I really needed was just a lot of lights. I'd started buying custom fonts to give the comic a better feel and to make it legible at different resolutions. The font of the words \"Adventures in\" in the first panel was the font I bought to do Wizard101 comics, as that's the font that game uses.



The Shepherd Fairey homage in panel 3 I did by hand in Inkscape because I couldn't figure out a way in Gimp to do it.



In this strip, Bear finds out his cutthroat tactics has made him a pariah on the Monopoly board, so he tries to entice new players to come play, but his true nature shines through.
