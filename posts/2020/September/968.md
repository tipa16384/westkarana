# Adventures in Monopoly -- Darkfall, Part III

Header pic has nothing to do with this comic. Header pic was based off an old John Varley story.



My sister had gone to Germany, and she brought me back a German Monopoly set, so it was always going to eventually show up here. The German set didn't have metal playing pieces. The German dialog is from Young Frankenstein. I'm pretty sure it should be \"Lass *ihn*\" instead of \"Lass *im*\". The Latin bit is the [Dies irae](\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dies_irae\"), and I probably used it because of Mozart writing music for it in \"Amadeus\". This comic is just a bunch of stuff I had lying around the house and in my head :-)
