# EQ2 and WoW, 2GETHA 4EVA

I went off to Amazon.com to pre-order The Shadow Odyssey so I could get that cool dire bear pet/mount (which will be claimed by Ettie, my 46 defiler), and halfway down the page, Amazon told me that people who pre-ordered the EQ2 expansion frequently pre-ordered Wrath of the Lich King at the same time.

I wonder how many people play both games?

I should be getting a free digital download of the expansion on my main account, since I went to Fan Faire and have gotten the Fan Faire cloak, so I'm in the system even though I attended on a press pass. I wasn't sure about that.

Going to be a VERY busy Fall, with EQ2:TSO and Spellborn all out the same month. And I bet KingsIsle releases the fifth Wizard 101 world, Dragonspyre, by then, too... just to make sure I have no free time, EVER!
