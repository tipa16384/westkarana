Spent some time in IRC and on the forums waiting with a lot of other Mythos fans for the rumored arrival of Mythos' Overworld, which turns the heavily-instanced game into a game which rewards exploration and wandering about in the same way Oblivion does.

I managed to get it patched (finally), play it for awhile and [do a quick write-up about it](http://www.massively.com/2008/05/29/a-first-look-at-mythos-overworld/) before I collapsed into bed. [So check it out](http://www.massively.com/2008/05/29/a-first-look-at-mythos-overworld/) :) I'm really excited about this game.

I'm recovering from a tooth extraction before I return to work :/
