# GAX Online

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-02-17 12:06:02*

I have no idea what GAX stands for, but it's the first gamer community which doesn't seem to be absolutely dead. I think they've hit upon the magic formula, and hope everyone joins -- already found far more people I know on Gax than on GuildCafe.

So: Go to [GAX Online](http://www.gaxonline.com/), register, write a couple of sentences saying what games you're playing in your new blog, say hi on the live chat bar, and invite Tipa to be your friend :)

Do it now!
