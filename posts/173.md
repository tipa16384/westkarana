*Is this a dagger I see before me, its handle toward my hand? Come, let me buy thee... I have thee not, yet I see thee still. Are thee not, fatal vision, as affordable to newbies as to farmers? Or art thou but a dagger of the mind, a false creation of a IGE-oppressed purse. I see thee yet, in form as palpable as this which now I draw. Thou marshall'st my desire, and such an instrument I was to buy. My plat is made the fool of the other adventurers, or worth all the rest.*

[Dan Rubenfield](http://rubenfield.com/blog/) posted a [controversial essay](http://rubenfield.com/blog/2006/06/28/in-which-i-crush-fanbois-dreams-of-an-equitable-mmo-world/) yesterday on why MMO developers should quit fighting the gold farmers and join them. [Amber Night](http://ambernight.org/) posted a [brilliant rebuttal](http://ambernight.org/archives/2006/06/28/266) which said what I wanted to say about that better than I ever could (though, being snarky, I did post a snarky comment on Dan's blog):

> I hope you
