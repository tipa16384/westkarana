#Blogmata#

I added House of Fame, the Geoffrey Chaucer blog, to the sidebar; it's hilarious.

Thinking of changing blog software. I went with Simple PHP Blog because it was... simple... simple enough for me to host and install it myself... but it looks so primitive compared to the other blogs I see. I am thinking about trading up.

I still can't figure Wordpress out. I can get it to run fine, sure, but to make it look like I want it to look... question marks over my head...
