# The RPG Challenge: Final Fantasy

*Posted by Tipa on 2021-07-31 23:19:27*


It's the first of Blaugust! The week where a lot of game bloggers come together and... blog... to show the world just how much fun typing can be :-)



So, for this month, I'll be playing the first Final Fantasy game. I never had a NES, so I never played it when it first came out. My first Final Fantasy game was Final Fantasy Mystic Quest, which wasn't even really a Final Fantasy game.



The remastered versions of the first three games (none of which were originally released in the United States) have been \"pixel remastered\" for the PC and released on Steam. So, for the next thirty one days, I will be journeying through Final Fantasy for the first time, and blogging about it here. We'll see what other things come up along the way. I hope you'll join me.



This will not be a walkthrough of Final Fantasy, I promise... well, not *only* that.

Should there be more? I feel like there should be more.



Okay. Here's my list of the best Final Fantasy games, that I have played.



* Final Fantasy Tactics -- there really shouldn't be any question about this. I've played it so many times, and it inspired my love of tactics RPGs. I've only played Tactics Advance, the sequel, once. I should see if it's been ported to anything I have.
* Final Fantasy VI -- I dunno how long I spent working my way through this. Every time I thought I had a handle on the game, it would just do something new.
* Final Fantasy IV -- I didn't expect them to kill off main characters like that. Cecil's redemption, Kain's betrayal... nothing was sacred.
* Final Fantasy VII -- This game was simply a joy. I loved the minigames, the leaning into the weird. I was as shocked as anyone at Aerith's death. Sephiroph always seemed a reluctant villain.
* Final Fantasy VIII -- Gunblade! That card game! The romance! That dance!
* Final Fantasy IX -- Final Fantasy mined its own history for a game that looked back in all the best ways.
* Final Fantasy XII -- I loved the gambit combat system. And the job boards. But... when I recently replayed it, it seemed more tedious than fun. This would continue.
* Final Fantasy XIII -- too linear, on rails. The characters really didn't connect with me. Never tried the sequels.
* Final Fantasy X -- didn't bother finishing it. Didn't play the sequels.
* Final Fantasy XV -- got bored with it. My boyfriend played through it awhile back. I don't feel I missed anything.



Short post, but it's just a week for beginnings.

This sounds like a fun challenge! I've been eying the pixel remakes but I really want them to come out on the Switch, so I'm holding off. (Not to mention I own the games in other formats). Will be interested to see how the game looks and plays!
