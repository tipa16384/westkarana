# Valheim: National No More Bosses Day

*Posted by Tipa on 2021-04-02 07:21:43*


I told everyone that Moder was enough for me. Killing her got us the best crafting, while the Plains boss, Yagluth, wouldn't particularly help us in any way, were we to kill him. Kasul was frankly against the idea -- he'd read that once Yagluth dies, the goblin Fulings would start spawning in the relatively friendly Meadows and Black Forest biomes, and suggested we'd probably need to start in a new world where the worst we'd have to worry about would be weak Greylings and boars.



Aftere the last patch, Stingite can't even connect to the server, so we wouldn't have the help of one of our best Vikings. Worse, Spode was stuck at work, so he couldn't be on. And, we only had enough stuff to summon Yagluth once (though we can get more). If we started the fight and couldn't finish it, we would be in a bad place.



Taking him on last night would be a very, very bad idea.

But if I didn't have bad ideas, I wouldn't have any ideas at all. I kicked the idea around with Calrain, and he was fine with it. Kasul said he'd do it, against his better judgment. I figured the three of us could do it, once, and get the gist of the fight, so we could do it even better when everyone else could make it.



I'd seen a couple YouTube videos of folks killing him solo, and it looked pretty easy.



Hah.

Giant stone fingers surround his summoning altar. My thought was that we could kite him around them, and hide from his attacks behind them. That *did not work*. His Godzilla breath punches right through the fingers, his burning aura ignores them, and his meteor shower will find you wherever you are.



I had this other idea that someone could get aggro while others would get behind and go smashy-smash with their Frostner (a freezing hammer that does a lot of damage to him). Nope. His aggro was all over the place and he would ignore someone right next to him to drop meteors on someone far away.



There were a couple of deaths. We'd built our forward base not far from the summoning altar, and as people popped back up naked after death, Yagluth would head straight for them and nothing I could do seemed to keep him near his spawn. Yagluth ended up tearing down a bit of the stake wall around the base before we could kite him far enough away.



I'd brought some healing potions that kept me alive. Those have to be mandatory with this fight, along with the fire resist potions and the best foods we could manage.

This was the most epic fight we've had in Valheim. This was the first fight where it looked like we might lose.



Frostner hurt Yagluth a LOT. The last swing of a three-hit combo would take a big chunk of his health. It's just a matter of avoiding his attacks long enough to do damage. The burning resistance mead meant the burning aura could be tanked somewhat. The meteors and godzilla breath were still dangerous, but the breath is easy enough to avoid (if you see him about to cast it), and the meteors are as well (if you don't see them falling on someone else and assume one won't be coming for you).



Once he did finally die, a swarm of goblins attacked unexpectedly. We'd fought through the entire day and must have run into one of the night patrols. There'd also been a few Deathsquitos during the fight itself to just make things a little more fun.



After we sacrificed Yagluth's crowned skull to the altar, we went and checked out the Ashlands. Calrain had sailed south and placed a portal there, and had started mining Flametal, a burning ore that is not currently used for anything.



Fun times :-)

We're still trying to get the group together for Moder, but I've been nosing around the plains some, and is seems like the possibility for adds could really spice up the fight.

If these goblins had hit us even a little earlier, we would have wiped for sure. As it was, Kasul and Calrain died at least three times each. It wasn't our greatest victory.
