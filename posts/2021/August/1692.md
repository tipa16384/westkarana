# FF3 -- Making Myself CoD-Worthy

*Posted by Tipa on 2021-08-17 22:41:03*


I didn't have big goals for tonight. Grind to 50 with the jobs I intend to take on the trip to the World of Darkness. And then... maybe jump into Final Fantasy XIV Online, and try the MMO version of FF3's final boss.



So that's what I did.





[![\"\"](\"https://chasingdings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/20210817221325_1-1024x576.jpg\")](\"https://chasingdings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/20210817221325_1.jpg\")

Three of the jobs are basically no-brainers. Ninja is the most capable physical attacker in the game. Devout is the best healer, and Sage is the best magical attacker, having access to all black magic, white magic, and summoner spells.



It's the last spot -- the second physical attacker -- that I am struggling to plan. Drew right now is a Black Belt, and he has nearly maxed this job. He's doing pretty well with that job, but there's a lot of good reasons to go for Dragoon, Dark Knight or Viking.



Right now, a double boosted Black Belt maxes out damage at 9,999, so that's about 3,333 damage per round. Ninja can do from 1,500 to 4,500 damage per round, depending on crits. So they're essentially similar, and we don't need two single target physical attackers.



Dark Knight has Bladeblitz, a decent multi-target attack. (Black Belt has Kick, but it doesn't do a lot of damage). Viking is the one real tank, and suggestions are to equip two shields and Provoke so that everyone else can do the killing.



I'll probably start out with the Black Belt and see how it goes, since the job is pretty well leveled.



Grinding levels in Ancient Maze was boring, so I checked in to FFXIV and tried one of the FF3 raids there :-)
