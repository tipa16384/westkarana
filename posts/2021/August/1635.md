# Okay -- the FULL LIST of Interesting Games!

*Posted by Tipa on 2021-08-13 19:39:45*


I'm not going to blast this post anywhere, but if someone was interested in what a full run of the Google Trendifier looks like with about 160 games on the list. I'm still counting it toward my Blaugust quota, though.





Some of the games on previous lists aren't on this one, as I decided to eliminate those that Google Trends Suggestions didn't label as an Online game or Video game, just to try and get the most fair comparisons possible.

## Comments!

**[Bhagpuss](http://bhagpuss.blogspot.com)** writes: Super-interesting list. Metin2 I've heard of many times but never bothered to investigate. I think Elsword is a Runescape clone, isn't it? I beleive I played it once. That would explain it's high placing. Being a Runescape clone, I mean, not that I played it! Dragon Saga and Redstone I don't know at all. 

The Steam entry for Shakes and Fidget may give some perspective on why there are so many unfamiliar-to-mmorpg-bloggers names on the list. \"Over 50 million players make it one of the most popular online games in the world!\" The name sounds vaguely familiar but that's all.

Anyway, I won't ramble on in a comment but I might use your sterling efforts for some kind of post of my own at some point.
