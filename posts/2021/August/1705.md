# Game Night: JotL \"The Gauntlet\"

*Posted by Tipa on 2021-08-19 22:43:57*


I'm kind of worried about the next time when we play \"Jaws of the Lion\", as we'll be confronting cultists again. I don't really know if I'll be able to fight against the Blue Oyster Cult...

I do try to print as much of the game as I can. I really have been slacking off, lately. I started out wanting to print all the hex tiles for all the dungeons, but the scenario book is so much more detailed...



I still plan to, once I get Frosthaven, start printing *everything*. Really make it special. I've told my board gaming group -- who are my family -- that after Jaws of the Lion, we're going to be taking a pause in campaign games and try to work through some of our considerable backlog.



We've spent many sessions working through some blood cultists and their dark blood god. It was nice to take a break from that and take a chance to compete on Gloomhaven Ninja Warrior -- The Gauntlet.

The Gauntlet isn't a dungeon. It's two rickety platforms connected by a shaky bridge. The starting platform has explosive traps that take out not only those that trigger it, but everyone in the area. The bridge has puffs of poison gas moving slowly across the path. The second platform has demons and traps that home in on the players.



It's all just a lot of good clean fun.



We figured out, early on, that we could focus on guiding, pushing and pulling the enemies into the traps, and let them do a lot of the work for us. My character, the Voidwarden, has mind control powers. I took out one enemy by having it run into one trap, and then into another. It couldn't even help itself.



Bit of a disappointment in the last room, where a black slime swallowed up our treasure chest :-( We might need to come back to get it.



The game gave us two choices for the next dungeon experience: The Defiled Sewers, in the bad part of town, and the Beguiling Sewers, where the posh patrons poop. Red-robed cultists were seen around both. The group voted to avoid the putrid pipes and head for the swanky sewers.
