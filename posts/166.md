# Compulsive Upgrade System Syndrome (CUSS)

I was out in the warehouse this morning, installing new software on the UPS machine... and during this long, dull process, was *looking* at the computer itself, an old Gateway, the flat kind you put on your desk and sat a monitor on top... Whatever happened to computers you put on your desk? I've used towers for years...

I think the last time I used a desktop one was back at Digital Research... and even then, those stretched the definition of desktop. To the computer pictured above, add another box (two feet wide, foot and a half deep, half a foot high) for the 20 megabyte hard drive. I didn't actually set a monitor on that behemoth; it was on a side table. I used a DEC VT520 terminal to talk to it. Command line. CP/M 68K. Yeah.



Anyway, I was looking at this thing, and wondering why I didn't just get a new case for Supernova, my gaming computer. Less stuff on the floor. I mean, I have to take it apart anyway to swap some drives between it and Baphomet (Linux non-gaming computer)... not sure I could stop myself from going overboard... I JUST bought that widescreen monitor (LOVING IT!). But a quieter case, smaller, that I could stash perhaps in the living room without seeming out of place...

That Antec case is just so nice... Sigh... I'm really sick. I have CUSS - Compulsive Upgrade System Syndrome. I guess I spend so much time with computers, I want them to look special.



I can't get too upset with myself over my computer hobby; after all, it DID get me my current job. Changing careers from programmer to IT tech isn't the usual path.
