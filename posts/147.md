Paragon City needs me back! City of Heroes is letting all the retired superheroes out of the superhero stasis chambers from now until the end of the week. I got a little excited when I read the email. There were some good memories in there...

I found City of Heroes repetitive after awhile. But flying was a lot of fun... I'm going to do it. I'm going to check in on my supergals once more. If I can find my CoH disks.

Flying really was a lot of fun.
