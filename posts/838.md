# Meme Wars

I think I dropped a previous Meme... well, this time I saw it before it got stale :) Thanks, Amber!

**-Start Copy-**

Itâ€™s very simple. When this is passed on to you, copy the whole thing, skim the list and put a * star beside those that you like. (Check out especially the * starred ones.)

Add the next number (1. 2. 3. 4. 5., etc.) and write your own blogging tip for other bloggers. Try to make your tip general.

After that, tag 10 other people. Link love some friends!

Just think- if 10 people start this, the 10 people pass it onto another 10 people, you have 100 links already!

1. Look, read, and learn. ***

**-End Copy-**

And now to pass it on... but to whom?

How about [Alaph](http://alaph.net), [Lars](http://wombatplanet.blogspot.com/), [Kanthalos](http://mmoreinsight.wordpress.com/), [Ravven](http://ravven.wordpress.com/), [Lishian](http://lishian.wordpress.com/), [Relmstein](http://relmstein.blogspot.com/), [Cass](http://cassaendra.blogspot.com/), [Yunk](http://www.plutospage.com/wow/), [JoBildo](http://bildos.blogspot.com/), and [DM Osbon](http://sweetflag.wordpress.com/). Because all these fine bloggers left comments recently on my blog or linked to me, and thus I love each one more than my own children, who have (to date) never left a comment!
