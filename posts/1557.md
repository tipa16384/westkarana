I wrote [a piece yesterday](http://www.massively.com/2008/04/21/missbimbo-when-satire-turns-serious/) about [MissBimbo.com](http://missbimbo.com), a game that teaches young girls how dieting and boob jobs are the path to a successful and rewarding life... and on the way to work, what drives by but a truck full of Bimbos... or something :)
