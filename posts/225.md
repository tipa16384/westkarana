# Maybe I'm Just Being Paranoid...

... but my boss is returning from Bali without warning way earlier than I had previously heard, I am being cautioned not to make any long-term changes to our IT setup, I am to write complete step-by-step descriptions of everything I do so that someone else could do it, the company isn't doing all that well this year compared to last, I have never gotten a pay raise since I started working here almost two years ago and I can't live on what they're paying me now...

I think the company is about to shrink its IT force by half. I've gotten this same vibe before other layoffs.

Anyone need a game-loving programmer/IT gal with 27 years experience?

Well, if I am *not* being paranoid and they really *are* out to get me, it's time to try and get into the MMO industry again. I've never pushed as hard as I can push for such a job, even though I live and breathe MMOs...
