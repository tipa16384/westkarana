Initial reviews of [Final Fantasy XII](http://www.insertcredit.com/archives/001012.html) look really good. This is the one that uses a FFXI Online-like world map. If they could let me make my own characters and use them, instead of pre-generated ones, this would be anything I could ever want in a console RPG. And it still may be.

Devices based upon Microsoft's [Origami project](http://www.origamiproject.com/) come out tomorrow. We're already seeing a lot of Origami machines coming out of CEBit, the German consumer electronics trade show. It looks to be a small, handheld, wireless, tablet PC running Windows XP. The geek in me (get out of me, you GEEK) wants one just to have... but I am not sure what I would really *do* with it. [This Origami video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=mHgkZ-yIQfM), made a year ago, has it doing just about everything. EVERYTHING. The buzz is that it will be sort of a super video iPod, with an online store likely called Alexandria.

Not sure I really need that. My media repository runs under Linux. Now, a Linux version of Origami might be nice...

In [Kingdom of Loathing](http://kingdomofloathing), the web-based game I began yesterday, I'm up to level 3, and working my way through the "Hobo's Map" puzzle. Currently looking for "something that combines the properties of a knife and a stalk of asparagus..." I managed earlier to work my through the Haiku Dungeon, and can now do Haiku in the Haiku chat.

Funny bit about [World of Warcraft as a text adventure](http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,70348-0.html?tw=rss.index) in Wired News today:

> Welcome to World of Warcraft: The Text Adventure.

You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building. Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully. There is an elf with an exclamation point above her head here.

> *Talk elf*

"Alas," she says. "There is a great darkness upon the land. Fifty years ago the Dwarf Lord Al'ham'bra came upon the Dragon Locket in the Miremuck Caverns. He immediately recognized the ..."

> *Click Accept*

"Hey," the elf protests. "This is important expository. Azeroth is a rich and storied land, with a tapestry of interwoven ..."

> *Click Accept*

"OK, fine. Bring me six kobold tails."
