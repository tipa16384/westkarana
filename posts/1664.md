Ooooo.... [Diablo III](http://blizzard.com/diablo3/) looks so cool....

Oh, I know this is the millionth blog to announce it, but whatever :) But it seems [Diablo 3 is real](http://news.bigdownload.com/2008/06/28/blizzards-newest-game-diablo-3/)! My kids and I all played D1 and D2 back in the day, though I'm not sure we ever played it *together*, this being before we got that whole LAN thing worked out.

With D3 on its way, the people over at Flagship Studios (many of whom worked on Diablo II) must be wondering how D3 will impact the forthcoming Mythos and the already-out Hellgate: London.

Mythos is still technically an MMO, but since it is soloable, there likely won't be much difference in actual play between that and D3. Soloable MMOs, after all, are just single player games with the occasional PC thrown in. I doubt playing D3 with a few friends will feel any different than doing an instance group in WoW.

Anyway, exciting news, I'm definitely looking forward to seeing it.
