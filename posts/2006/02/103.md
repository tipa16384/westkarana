Here's how you look like in EQ2 *and* here's your new .sig! All in one, compact, package! Just like you! Along with some commemorative Anguish armor :)

Sorry it took so long!

Oh yes... if you ever *do* end up playing EQ2, you owe Ironchief ten gold; Zefara likes to be held snugly before bed; the Gnashtooth gnolls demand the return of their young scout Wrathtail, whom you have renamed "Fluffy" and keep in a cage in your room; you like the 'Hawks for the Superbowl; and you never start a sentence without the word "dude".
