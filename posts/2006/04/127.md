# NationStates progress

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-04-12 00:00:00*

There was a week that went by without me sending in my Nationstates moves, but I've been keeping up with it lately. My nation, Dryroot, recently passed 500 million people, which makes it a superpower. Well, here's how it stands. And ignore that bit about being the third most corrupt government in the region; there are only three countries in the region, so Dryroot is the *least* corrupt. We haven't swallowed up any fellow countries recently either... unlike SOME country I could name...
