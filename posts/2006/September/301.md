# EQ2: O RLY?

Saw these guys in Barren Sky while I was finishing a quest and nearly fell off the chain laughing.

I also won a Relic Chain Coat last night! It's rare to begin with, and I outrolled the other chain wearers to boot, so it just goes to show - sometimes one-in-a-hundred chances do actually happen.

O RLY? YA RLY!

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: There were only five places where Aviaks could be found in EQ1: South Karana, Butcherblock, the Ocean of Tears, Lake Rathetear and Timorous Deep. The only nameds were Krak Windchaser in SK and the one for the warrior epic 1.0 in OoT -- don't remember his name, but it was along the lines of Krak's. (I dimly recall random aviaks here and there as window dressing; I believe there was one in the prison outside the High Priest's room in the Temple of Ssraezsha, and perhaps one in Guk somewhere. Aviaks were not, as a rule, well-liked in EQ1. And neither are they in EQ2.)

Orly and Yarly aren't aviaks, though - they are Hooluks. Aviaks are hawk/eagle people; Hooluk are owl people (and Vultaks are vulture people, just to round out the birdfolk in the Kingdom of Sky).

I'd still like to see an aviak treehouse somewhere in EQ2. And I'd like to see a game where waiting for a spot in the top room (what WAS the name for that?) would be worth the wait!
