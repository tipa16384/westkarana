Saw these guys in Barren Sky while I was finishing a quest and nearly fell off the chain laughing.

I also won a Relic Chain Coat last night! It's rare to begin with, and I outrolled the other chain wearers to boot, so it just goes to show - sometimes one-in-a-hundred chances do actually happen.

O RLY? YA RLY!
