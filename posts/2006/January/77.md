I used that word below; thought I made it up but Google says otherwise. Anyway, I liked the word and decided to Flickr-ize it with [this cute script](http://metaatem.net/words/) that spells any word with [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) images.

Oh yay, Google finally indexed this site... time to toss in the adwords and retire on all the $$$...
