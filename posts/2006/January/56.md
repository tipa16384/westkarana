# Dryroot Update

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-01-11 00:00:00*

This morning, I was kinda alarmed when I pulled up the [dossier for Dryroot](http://www.nationstates.net/dryroot) and found it had gone from being a nation with lush forests, to a barren, inhospitable wasteland. HUH? What did I do?

Luckily, in today's afternoon update, some regrowth had kicked in, and though still bereft of forests, Dryroot is no longer such a wasteland. However, the government is - it's HUGE.

At least I am keeping the taxes low.
