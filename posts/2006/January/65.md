# Skinning my Blog

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-01-19 00:00:00*

I finally got sick of the default skin for this blog, and after having skinned the [Prophetic Fate](http://fate.westkarana.com) version successfully, decided to go for a new look here.

I had this vision of an illuminated (like monks used to do) title against parchment. So step one was: make a nice parchment texture.

So [what is parchment](http://www.sca.org.au/scribe/articles/parchment.htm), anyway? Well, it's the stretched, pounded, shaved and coated skin of a young, preferably unborn, calf or lamb.

How cheery. Luckily, we have computers, that can skin a million virtual unborn calves each and every second.

I chose a light cream color in Photoshop for my background. I created a new layer and set the foreground color to a slightly darker color with a hint of red, rendered clouds with it, then backed down the transparency so that all was left was an interesting texture. I then added random noise to give it a stretched look.

*et voila*, parchment.

The header was a box of that same color. I used that sexy Oz Handicraft font that we use for the Basil & Maude logo, added a pompous subtitle, and a lens flare, because lens flare makes anything look cool.

I also made the font size larger so I could read it...
