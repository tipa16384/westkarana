# When MMOs Compete for Your Dollars...

Hard on the heels of NCSoft's impassioned plea to get my back into City of Heroes, Mythic is hot to have my amazing kung fu Bard and Minstrel action back into DAoC. Unbeknownst to them, I have come back to DAoC twice already. The newbie grounds are vast wastelands; nobody I know plays anymore... all I'd be on for is to take new screen shots but honestly, WoW and EQ2 are both better games and I'm already paying for those.

I loved my Minstrel though. Little Saracen bringer of musical death...
