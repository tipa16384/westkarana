I know, I shouldn't have bought it. I can't really afford it. But I love my widescreen monitor. And I haven't even tried to play a game on it.



Took me about half an hour to teach Linux about it, mostly because of a stupid typo I made in the xorg,conf... but since then... movies... being able to work on the new website design, watch a DVD, touch up graphics with the GIMP...



The guy tried to sell me another monitor, more expensive, naturally. Not widescreen. But this is soooo nice... The one hitch: all those TV episodes I downloaded look muddy at super high resolution....
