# Rakuraku Dinokun!

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-06-06 00:00:00*

A long long LONG time ago... like half the rest of the world, I was crazy about virtual pets. My favorite? Rakuraku Dinokun (or Friendly Little Dino). My old blog from around 1996-2000, Penultimatum, was disappeared (and the domain name stolen, STOLEN, by someone else!), but the Internet Archive had bits and pieces... including some of my painstakingly hand-drawn and animated scenes from a Dinokun's life. Some of these live on in other people's pages... I made these on a Macintosh. I hadn't yet used a PC...

**aya** writes: yeah, i want my old one back. it was like aqua i think. i bought one off ebay, but it's all cheap and crappy and it turned out to be a dog, not the dinosaur. $$$7.00 down the drain. i still want a real one, real bad. can you email me too please if you know where to get one?

**susan** writes: i just found one! I GOT AN ORIGINAL.\r\n\r\nhard, but yaa, i got the white one for $12 off of ebay. you have to make sure you get the EXACT one though. here's a pic on the original (don't buy anything else that looks KINDA' like it, make sure it's EXACT; this goes for packaging as well): http://www.bookmice.net/fleur/rakuraku/raku-5.jpg\r\n\r\nsadly the seller only had one (he found it in his basement when he was cleaning it or something), so good luck finding one.

**Tipa** writes: I wonder what it is about the Dinokuns that make them popular still, fifteen years later? Someday, I'll dig my old ones out and see what it hatches into. Thanks for the eBay link!
