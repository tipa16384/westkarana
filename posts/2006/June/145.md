# Rakuraku Dinokun!

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-06-06 00:00:00*

A long long LONG time ago... like half the rest of the world, I was crazy about virtual pets. My favorite? Rakuraku Dinokun (or Friendly Little Dino). My old blog from around 1996-2000, Penultimatum, was disappeared (and the domain name stolen, STOLEN, by someone else!), but the Internet Archive had bits and pieces... including some of my painstakingly hand-drawn and animated scenes from a Dinokun's life. Some of these live on in other people's pages... I made these on a Macintosh. I hadn't yet used a PC...
