# EQ2: Betraying Qeynos - Proving My Worth

Freeport loves that whole "I am the MASTER, you must OBEY!" vibe, and to show me what that meant, they had me train a war dog captured from a Qeynos soldier. His name was Buddy; he was the cutest thing. I had to feed him and pet him maybe a hundred times before he would trust me, and then patiently teach him to sit and play dead. He was the best dog EVER! But Matthias made me give him to a lonely orphan, who promised to take good care of him. I showed the little tyke that one spot on Buddy's neck that he really liked to get scratched. With a tear in my eye, I bid Buddy farewell, but I knew he would be happy in his new home. At peace forever.

Qeynos insurgents had been spotted in Freeport. They even suspected me! The only way I could prove I was no Qeynos agent would be to search out the insurgent stronghold in Antonica and kill them all.

The leader had a half dozen squires with her, and she came at me with elemental summonses and finally, she herself changed to a magical form and attacked, but my worm, Busby, along with my magic, made short work of them all.

I gated to Haven one last time and rushed to the Commonlands, killing the local wildlife until I made my 21st level on my way to the city. Well, on my way home, I guess. I'd passed all their tests --

All but one. I had to give up the powers of a Conjurer. They don't allow Conjurers in Freeport. The necromancer trainer was very firm - nothing of what I was would remain. I didn't think long on it. I didn't come this far only to turn back.

The pain was excrutiating. My life was ripped in two and half discarded. My love for harmony and family were torn asunder; and I was remade a necromancer. My hair lost its bright color and became stringy and gray. My new pet - a spider - glowered menacingly at me. But my family came by... Dina had a bed for me in her huge apartment, and my mom, Etha, had made all new spells for me.

So; Freeport... home... I feel both empty and expectant, as if I'm on the verge of something great. I've already been told that the best kind of halfling pie is the kind with halfling as the main ingredient.

I killed them.

It felt good.

Actually, I did have to kill Buddy. But I was writing this last bit in character, and Dorah felt awful about it, and she didn't want to make herself seem evil. So she lied, but hinted at the truth ("at peace forever"). The old betrayal quest had you go around and ruin people's lives, I expected Buddy would have to die in this one. And as a pet-lover, I really did feel bad about it.

Love your blog, btw.
