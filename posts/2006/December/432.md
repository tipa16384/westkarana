# Interview with Clint Gilcrush

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-12-14 11:55:33*

I was floored when Pilotman told me that Curt Schilling's in-game avatar was in fact still in the game, on the Thundering Steppes docks. I journeyed out to visit with him and talked with him a bit about politics, giggling goblins and his plans for the future.

**Dina: Thanks for much for agreeing to speak with me today! It is a great honor to be here. If I may ask, how did you come to live on these docks?**

Clint: Look at me. I am successful. Needed. Wanted... *Feared*. You know who got me here? *I did*.

**Dina: I can imagine it's quite a struggle. All those newbie quests and horrid pickup groups... From your dual wielding crushing weapons and your talk of causing fear in others, you can only be a bruiser. Did the Overlord send you here?**

Clint: The Overlord... Tell me, why do you submit to the will of a government that cares nothing for you?

**Dina: The Overlord keeps Freeport strong. If we may leave politics behind a bit... with your real life counterpart becoming a game developer in his own right, where does that leave you in the game?**

 Clint: I don't bow to the will of insignificant figureheads. One day we will all rise up and take what is rightfully ours.

**Dina: Strong words. So you intend to not only compete with, but crush, SOE?**

Clint: What makes you think SOE knows what is best for me? I decided for myself what was best for me.

**Dina: Many have speculated that SOE would put you in a dark room somewhere, where giggling goblins would torment you for their pleasure. I can't help but notice the giggling goblin just over there has been shooting you mean looks as we've been talking.** 

Clint: Keep your eyes peeled, friend. Leave Lucan and Antonica to play alone in their sandboxes.

**Dina: Well. It's been a pleasure, Mr. Gilcrush, and I wish you success within the game to toss the world into anarchy and civil war, and out of the game in your new venture, Green Monster Games. Any last words for our readers?**

Clint: Govern yourself. Be your own figurehead.
