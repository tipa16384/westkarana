# The Best Christmas Present in the World

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-12-24 23:33:04*

My grandson Matthew Edward was born this afternoon, 1:49 PM, December 24, 2006!

More later... someone hacked my blog so I put up this temporary theme until I get it all sorted out. I was going to redesign it anyway.

Merry Christmas to everyone!

And yup, first grandchild! Now to get my son working on some. Of course, he's only 19 and not dating anyone at the moment, so it could be awhile.

I understand grandkids are more fun than kids, but I've got another 20 years or so to find out for myself.

Gotta make sure he doesn't get a combined Christmas/Birthday celebration though - that sucks. Seperate parties for each!
