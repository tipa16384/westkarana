# Eureka: All Icing, No Cake

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-07-19 00:00:00*

Sat down in anticipation last night for Eureka, the SciFi channel's newest show.

I turned on the TV a little early and caught the end of "Dead Like Me", where a young woman is just getting started in her new job as the Grim Reaper, with Mandy Patinkin as her mentor. The bits I saw were okay; I'd watch it again.

Anyway: Eureka. The [website for the show](http://madeineureka.com) is funny and satirical. What they need to do is take the people who worked on the website, and put them in charge of writing the show.

Opened with a nerd guy inventing something that cuts holes in space time. He panics, gets his wife and they panic, grab their son and run. They stop for gas, and a spherical chunk of rogue space-time chews off the back of their RV - where their son was.

Cut to a rainy night. A federal marshall (our hero! swoon!) is transporting a fugitive - a teenage girl - back to Los Angeles. We soon find she's not only a fugitive, she's his daughter, and she is rebelling against her separated parents. Two things happen in quick succession: They are passed by themselves going in the opposite direction, and a dog runs in front of the car. They crash, manage to get out of the car, and find themselves in Eureka. Where odd things are happening.

People drive solar-powered cars (well, during the day, anyway). (And aren't electric cars silent? These electric cars sound like they have turbines under the hood). Children scribble equations on the sidewalk with chalk. Every woman is a model and every man is a nerd, making this some sort of nerd paradise, I guess. The town mechanic will rebuild your crashed car into some sort of bionic speed machine.

The marshall gets suspicious pretty quickly, and is drawn to solve the mystery of the missing boy and the hole in space time. They find the missing bit of the RV a couple miles away, and the chief nerd explains that the space-time stasis bubble had merely stayed in place while the world rotated beneath it.

This avoids the fact that the rotation of the Earth is dwarfed by the velocity of the Earth moving around the Sun in its orbit, the Solar System's orbit around galactic center, and the movement of our galaxy away from the center of the universe. That little bubble should have burst somewhere in deep space.

Space-time bubbles (or, more properly, [bobbles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marooned_in_Realtime)), happen a couple of more times, and Mr. Marshall asks chief nerd to use his program to track everything in the universe back to its source, to triangulate these three events back to their origin.

Town full of nerds, kids who read textbooks for fun, and they needed a sophisticated program to do 7th grade geometry...

Anyway, they tour Muppet Labs, blow their special effects budget for the rest of the season, introduce the mysterious Section 5 where all the cool stuff hides. They eventually resolve the mystery, find the missing kid (he was in the non-bobbled part of the RV all the time), Mr. Marshall becomes the new police chief, the villainess is revealed (and is in full vamp mode in the previews for next week's episode, so that's spoiled without me saying anything about it), and...

Well. On the scale of SciFi channel shows where Stargate is at the crappy end of the scale, and Battlestar Galactica is at the wonderful end, this falls nearer the crappy end. If they'd had the humor they showed in their website, or some real science fictional plot to it, this could have been a winner. Instead, it's absolute vanilla icing. Looks good, but you're not tasting anything you haven't tasted before. All icing and no cake.

*The diagram above was made with OpenOffice 2.0's Draw module. It's okay, but nothing will take my beloved Aldus SuperPaint's place in my heart. Since the exported figure looked crappy, I read it into Inkscape and re-rendered it. Along the way, I happened upon Wikipedia's entry on [the Triangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle), which gave a lot of insights into the various centers of triangles and their uses.*

**Tipa** writes: The concept WAS great. Problem was, I think, the choice of the viewpoint character, Mr. Marshall. They want us to identify with him, and slowly introduce us to Eureka and its inhabitants through him.

They should have killed him off in the first hour.

Better plan: Make Chief Nerd the main character. Heck, don't even let people know Eureka's relation to our present for a few episodes. Have the reveal not be that there is this small town which is really an advanced research facility, but that there is this advanced research facility secretly -- could it be on Mars? The Moon? A hundred years from now? We don't know! But it's actually manipulating present-day events! Sort of like Asimov's Foundation series, especially Second Foundation.

Or make Vampy Villain the main character. She knows the town and the people, but she wants to gain control. 

Instead, it's Star Trek. Magic devices and gobbledygook for any situation, a new one every week.

I'll watch it anyway, just because the show that precedes it, "Dead Like Me", looks good. As long as it doesn't veer too near "Touched By An Angel" territory. I loved its edginess. Definitely closer to BG than SG1 on the crappy scale.

**Amber** writes: Okay, finally watched it last night. Mostly disappointed, looks like it's going to be another Stargate, only not as good. (and I'm not a Stargate fan)

The "romantic" sub-plot was insulting at best, and there wasn't a single character who moved beyond the cardboard dimension. The Marshall was about the least convincing law enforcement officer ever, and his daughter was about the least convincing angst-filled teenager ever. Vamperilla may turn out to be interesting, but even she was a sad cliche in the over-(Joy Of)sexed villianess vein.

I may watch one or two more episodes, but unless they get their act together fast, it gets un-Tivoed. The best thing I can say about those 2 hours was that I caught the preview for the next season of Battlestar Galactica, and holy crap WOW! I can't wait for October!
