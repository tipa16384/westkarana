Bugs. I HATE bugs! Especially HUGE bugs.

These insects swarmed from one of the many hives in Silithus; and they were the heralds of a darker power, the dog-headed Emissary Roman'Khan. They all deeply craved death; and some of them even achieved it.

We (meaning my WoW guild, not me personally) defeated Lucifron; in Molten Core; I posted some of the screenshots from others over at the [Prophetic Fate](http://fate.westkarana.com/) website.
