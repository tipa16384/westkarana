# Queen Sendaii Dead...

I didn't really expect to be able to raid last night, but when I logged in the guild had *just* wiped, and there was a spot for me... so... I was able to attend a raid I thought I would never see. Queen Sendaii is a two hour fight, and I think it was pretty fun. The guild has been hammering on this raid night after night while I was at work or playing some other game, so I can't take any credit.

What I CAN do is put up the new news sooner than usual! This gets the guild access to the final zone of the Depths of Darkhollow expansion, The Demiplane of Blood.

Visit the [Crimson Eternity home page](http://www.crimsoneternity.com) for the full news, but I thought I'd go through it here.

The one joke I wanted to be sure to include was about Jordis' many deaths. She must have died ten times, and she had this huge pile of bodies in the middle of the room. Unfortunately, nobody (me included) had a picture of the bodies (though you can see one of them in panel 5), but Sashia did send a picture of Queen Sendai perhaps about to contribute body #1, so that was always going to be the punchline for the joke.

I wanted to get in a Cheney joke to start it off. Now, I haven't put politics in the news before. I was going to use the Sandra Day O'Connor resignation to put Warden Hanvar on the high court, but by the time I got around to doing the news for Hanvar, it wasn't topical any more.

With the Cheney joke in panel 1, I needed a transitional panel to get us into the Hive, hence the "Eggs of Mass Destruction" joke in panel 2, plus a drive-by joke about domestic spying. I really tried to keep the politics moderate, but once you start with the political jokes, it's hard to stop.

Hundreds of spiders pop during the event, and I wanted to mention that somehow. Panel 4 was going to be a joke about the Iraq insurgency and terror groups, but I couldn't think of anything snappy enough for a small panel, so I just went with the vengeful joke.

No joke in the last panel. It was a lot of hard work by a lot of dedicated people and, well, we made it!
