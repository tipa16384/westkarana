# Ignore me, I'm over-reacting.

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-11-21 11:48:13*

Business is incredibly slow here at Surya at the end of a year. This year, we're asked to work only four-day work weeks in December. Now since I'm salaried, I shouldn't care, as I supposedly get a fixed annual pay regardless of how much or how little I work.

That was the meaning of 'salaried' every other place I ever worked. Here, however, it's used as a starting point from which money is deducted. So no matter how much I work I can never make *more*. If I miss any time, however, I will make *less*. So these days I am being told to take off in December will be taken from my salary.

My boss informed me of this this morning. I'd heard the hourly people were going to a four day work week in December, but figured I'd be asked to work all five days since I was salaried. And I am perfectly willing to do just that. Anyway she came down, told me that yes indeed I was to be taking a day off too, and Monday would be bad but perhaps... Friday would be best?

Well, let's have a stare at December's calendar.

We get Christmas, the 25th, off. Friday would be *five full days* of no pay, while Monday would only be *three*. My boss explicitly asked me to come in on Mondays because that's when things are busiest.

She thinks I am an idiot. She thinks I will just agree to anything she says because I am a quiet person who keeps to herself. She thinks I don't know what the *rest* of the world means by "salaried" -- which she thinks means "hourly with unpaid overtime".

Well, maybe I am over-reacting. I know my friends must roll their eyes and sigh "not again..." but heck, I lose money each month I work here. If I didn't have the dregs of the money I made selling my house, I would have no money at all. Five full days of no pay in December would hurt me *a lot*. I don't have a husband helping with the bills.

The work at Surya is good and the people are great, but I can't afford to work here any more. Playing tricks with my income just makes me angry in a passive-aggressive way.

If they said that I was also going to get paid less for those weeks I would say, "Sure.... As soon as you pay me for all the overtime that I've put in." 

If they had any problem with that I would immediately begin looking for a new job. I wouldn't quit until I had a new job though. 

Unfortunately I have heard of some places doing this. Which is why if I ever get offered a salaried position that is the first question I ask.

It's one of the jobs you always hope you'll happen upon. I have kept on all this time despite the low salary (which by the way was a surprise; I had thought this was an hourly job when I got it) because I'd hoped for a raise. It's been nearly two years and there's no indication I will ever have enough to live on unless I kick my son out of the apartment and move to somewhere even cheaper.
