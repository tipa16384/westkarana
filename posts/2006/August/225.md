# Maybe I'm Just Being Paranoid...

*Posted by Tipa on 2006-08-11 09:39:42*

... but my boss is returning from Bali without warning way earlier than I had previously heard, I am being cautioned not to make any long-term changes to our IT setup, I am to write complete step-by-step descriptions of everything I do so that someone else could do it, the company isn't doing all that well this year compared to last, I have never gotten a pay raise since I started working here almost two years ago and I can't live on what they're paying me now...

I think the company is about to shrink its IT force by half. I've gotten this same vibe before other layoffs.

Anyone need a game-loving programmer/IT gal with 27 years experience?

Well, if I am *not* being paranoid and they really *are* out to get me, it's time to try and get into the MMO industry again. I've never pushed as hard as I can push for such a job, even though I live and breathe MMOs...

FWIW I and all my colleagues are similarly waiting for news in a few weeks in Sept. of where the axe is going to fall. At the very least, you sound extremely qualified. And it's a great time again in the business. Good luck.

He may be coming back for mundane not-firing-Tipa reasons, and probably I AM being paranoid. But it's a good thing even if I am not fired, to have a reason to stand up, get resume and references in order, and take a look around and see what's out there.

It's a good job, but I'd rather be in gaming than in fashion.
