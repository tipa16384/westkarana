Finally FINALLY done leveling Dina. I've caught up!

Last night when I logged in, I immediately got invited to a guild Halls of Fate run. It was my first time there! Lots of nameds; unfortunately the loot was kind of meh, but the experience was good and we finished the run with me just 3% from 70!

There was no way I was going to do anything besides finish this level.

So I worked on some Bonemire quests using my super leet bard soloing powers (hit 'em from behind, burn 'em down). I had LFG up -- just in case.

I got a Palace of the Awakened group *just* as I reached 100% on the bar. I debated for a moment killing something along the way just to ding, but thought it would be more fun to ding on the first kill in a group.

They didn't even notice!

Oh well... but heck yeah, finally there.
