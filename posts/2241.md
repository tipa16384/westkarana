Just saw that [Aeria Games](http://aeriagames.com) is [adding Shin Megami Tensei](http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/55737) to its stable of free-to-play Asian import MMOs. Brought to the West previously as single player games for the Playstation consoles and known here as Persona, Shin Megami Tensei will be a horror/fantasy MMO where high school and university students battle the forces of evil by bonding with Personas that give them supernatural powers.

I loved the Persona series back on the Playstation; I was really into the Japanese RPG scene back then, and these were some of the best. Twisted, dark plots.

Aeria Games is best known for MMOs like Twelve Sky, Dream of Mirror Online and Pi Story, but with SMT, they could be stepping off to a more story driven direction.

Should be fun, and I'm actually between MMOs at the moment...
