# One less Station Pass member.

I cancelled my old credit card and my recurring subscriptions, like my old Virgin cellphone account I couldn't unsubscribe from, and Station Pass, finally ended. I looked at what the Station Pass offered me and... well, out of all the games SOE offers, I only play EQ2. Station Pass is a phenomenally poor value for me. This was brought home to me last week when a co-worker was talking about starting a character in EQ2, since Lishian and I are always talking about it, and he wanted to know if I was paying $15.00 a month for it and I said, no, I was choosing to spend even more.

I took my son's account off Station Pass last time this happened, now my second account is off. I will probably keep my main account on so until I see if Pirates of the Burning Sea is worth paying for (and if I have time to play another MMO).

But for now... well, I always intended to cut down on my Station Pass subscriptions since they raised the price unless they added some value to those who play just one of their games... which they have not. Their EQ2 Players stuff is extra, they no longer make Adventure Packs (which were free to Station Pass members), the only game they currently offer of AAA quality (in my opinion, and at this time) is EQ2, and though I miss my EQ1 characters, I only log them on to take screenshots for my blog header and that just isn't worth $15+/month to me.

I'll be back when they add value to it.
