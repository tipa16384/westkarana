#In Memoriam: Brief AFK#

My father passed away last Friday. He had been battling a brain tumor for two and a half years, and through most of it was active and healthy and able to continue on nearly as normal. The tumor, though, would take bits away -- a word here and there, until near the end he could hardly be understood. A terrible punishment for a man of great strength, intelligence, and humor.

I moved back to New England so I could spend more time with him. I thought he would have longer. I thought maybe it would just go away. I thought I'd always be able to go up there on a weekend and have breakfast at the old truck stop on 3A.

I thought things would always be the same. Dad was a rock. He was always there for us, no matter what. We tried to be his rock but we weren't as strong.

I love you, Dad.
