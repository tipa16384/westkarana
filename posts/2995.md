# Acclaim's Double Bonus Coins weekend means Spellborn cheaper!

Like or hate the price of a Spellborn subscription rising and falling with the price of Acclaim Coins, it can work to your advantage.

March 27th - 29th, Acclaim is having another Bonus Coin Weekend. For the price of a Silver Membership (if you don't have one) and $70 for the coins, you can purchase enough coins for nine months of Spellborn for $80 (or $70 if you already have a membership). This makes the effective monthly rate to play the premium side of the game cheaper than any subscription MMO of which I'm aware.

This doesn't protect you from Acclaim changing its Spellborn premium subscription from 1500 to 1800 coins a month once its introductory pricing plan ends. But maybe they will reconsider that.

Anyway.

Cheap coins this weekend. Great game. If you've been waiting for the coins to get cheaper before subscribing, well, they are as cheap as they get.
