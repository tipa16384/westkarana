#EQ2: Raiding the Shard of Hate#

I took the night off from writing last night because, well, some things are more important. Sometimes, a gamer has just got to GAME. And if not the night when the Shard of Hate returns to Norrath, well, when? Before I get started, though, I want a shout out to a person who has always been there for me, held me up when I was falling; gave me strength to carry on; he is the wind beneath my wings; and -- well, he wants to know why I never mention him on my blog.

He's our MT, and I loves the dorf.

Delusions of Grandeur is kinda unique in always meeting at the same spot before every raid -- on the Sinking Sands dock. I'm not sure why we meet there -- I think it probably goes back to when the guild was on the Guk server. In a raid it's too busy to socialize, and in guild chat everyone is just a name. Gathering together in one spot in the game each night, well, this is the guild. We can give each other stuff, duel, check out everyone's new appearance armor and illusion spells... it's where masters are rolled upon and given out, it's just really nice to all be in one spot. It means also we move from place to place together, as a guild.

After a bunch of discussion, off we went to the Shard of Hate in Nektulos Forest. Turns out there's a really quick way to get there -- take the carpet from Sinking Sands to the Darklight Woods, run west to the Nektulos Forest zone, and that lets you out within a few feet of the Hate zone. See? There's a reason we gather there.

Almost every raiding guild on Befallen was there along with us. I saw Clan of Shadows (hey peeps!), Defiant, #1 guild Virulence (including my former Revolution guild leader, Xagain! HEYA X!)

The zone is a huge loop with two Tier 1 bosses, a Tier 2 boss and two Tier 4 bosses -- five bosses total. We went up to the right first, and killed the SK one who had this amazing knockback and stun. We learned an important lesson -- clear ALL the trash. We did this and got him down second time. We also got the quest to use the mender, which requires killing the three easier nameds.

He dropped a Beacon of Loathing, I believe? A nice mage item.

Off to the left now, and past Master P'Tasa, whom everyone was ragging on for being named after [Master P](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_P).

This was after the Plane of Hate was changed to a group zone, and people would be roaming through the place at all hours farming stuff, not least of which was Magi P'Tasa's staff for the mage epic, which could easily fetch 100K plat or more. Mages are decent at soloing, but a level 60 mage is doing about all she can to keep the place even barely clear, especially when the hated Clerics would spawn. Or those magic resistant spite golems. At this time, my cleric was still on the Stromm server so I couldn't two box her (which would have made it easy), so I used my daughter's cleric from back when she played, and over the course of those days, got her four or five levels. Lots of people from CE would stop by now and then so I could get some sleep, because if I ever stopped camping the place, it would be taken.

After taking care of the other easy named (dropped a server-discovery mage dagger), we turned to no longer Magi, but Master P'Tasa. If you attack him, he has a chance to go invulnerable for four seconds. He also has a rather awful curse, and though we tried a lot of things, we didn't kill him last night. At least one guild killed him with a scout tanking him, and there were rumors that fighters could not attack him at all without triggering Bad Stuff, though I think we showed that wasn't the case.

That will wait for another night, though. It was a heck of a lot of fun being someplace new. Running through the T1 and T2 raids all the time is getting a little old.

What would new content be without a quest? This one starts with a happy or delighted mob of some sort in everyone's home city. Well, unless you're good-aligned, in which case I guess they would be alarmed or frightened, but really, who cares about them? I'm just happy that my quest led me to the most awesome city in all of EQ2, Neriak.

In Neriak, you must sow hatred and discord throughout the land to show your fealty to the Lord of Hate himself, Innoruuk. First task; kill the night janitor at the opera house. Gee. Well. I am sure news of his death will resound throughout these cavernous.... HEY! Give me something a little more heroic than that! Okay, next task: Mine twelve rancor quartzes in Neriak. HUH? I throw myself into devotion for one of the big mojo evil gods in the game and this is what you have me do? She takes my stones and sends them into the Shard of Hate to soak up the hateness, and gives me some already-filled with hate stones and wants me to bury them in Darklight Woods.

Okay, so here I am, in the most evil city in the game doing a quest for the most evil god, the same one who warped high elves into dark elves, created the most supremely evil race in the game from the one with the most good, and my jobs are: Kill a janitor, mine some rocks, and bury them?

Yup. That's it. That's my evil task. Not even a puppy to kick.

Got a nice barbecue grill out of it, though. Anyone want a stake? Er, STEAK! Ignore that vampire standing there!!!!
