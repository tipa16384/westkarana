# STO: "Operation Gamma", part 1.

I've been struggling to get through this comic. The only good joke I had was toward the end, and it was a slog getting through to that point. So, I'm going to just make a NEW comic that speeds through all this beginning stuff. Since it shouldn't go to waste, here's the prologue to part 2.
