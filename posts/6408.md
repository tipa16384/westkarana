# EQ Nostalgia: Old Freeport in Minecraft

*Posted by Tipa on 2011-06-24 06:08:15*

For all those old EverQuesties who remember the glory of Freeport before it was ruined and destroyed in the Prophecy of Ro expansion, [Utenan1](http://www.youtube.com/user/utenan1) has recreated West and North Freeport in Minecraft. They are so dead-on that even more than a decade in, I could still find my way around blindfolded. (Can anyone claim that with new Freeport?)
