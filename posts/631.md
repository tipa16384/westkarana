*Farmers outside Staddle*

1. Bree-tard

2. Shire shortie

3. Rivendell rube

4. Luin loser

5. Dwarf

Quick notes: Wolves can be found in the Midgewraith (sp?) Pass that drop the skins, tails, paws and so forth for various quests. They also are the only mobs I have killed that drop medium hides for tailoring!

Based on chat, Hunters are the most popular class, followed by Champions. Burglars are the least-played class. Lore masters, captains and guardians are somewhere in the middle and probably in that order. I started a Burglar, but the class is just too boring.

All of the Fellowship is in Rivendell, except Gimli. Gimli is just outside Rivendell in the Misty Mountains, with his brother Gloin. I haven't seen Merry or Pippin yet, actually.

The zone progression past level 15 goes: Lone Lands from 15-25, Trollsharm from 25-35, Misty Mountains from 35-45, and probably Ettinwoods (the PvM zone) from there to 50.

Prospecting is the most popular sub-profession, so expect to be racing a crowd for every node. Based on the 24/7 group of farmers at a certain workbench outside Staddle (you can see three in the picture above, but when I go there in the evening there's easily a dozen farming bots going there), I would guess Farming would be the most profitable profession and the easiest to do AFK.
