# Vanguard Game Update 5 preview!

![Telon traffic jam](http://www.massively.com/media/2008/05/vgclient-2008-05-01-18-36-02-20.jpg)

Last Thursday I did a huge interview with Vanguard developer Lenny "Tiraslee" Gullo, and as well as talking a LOT about the upcoming VG game update, he let me play with a lot of the new mounts and showed off some of the new spell graphics.

Well, after wrangling with Windows Movie Maker for a few days (the heat of a thousand exploding stars cannot come close to my frustration at that program's limitations, but at least it's free), I finally finished putting it in some sort of shape, and it's being rolled out on Massively in three parts today.

The first post, where we show off the new mounts, [is up now](http://www.massively.com/2008/05/06/exclusive-vanguard-game-update-5-preview/). Later today is a spell effects video, and this afternoon is the mega-interview where a lot of information about the quests to get the mounts is revealed... as well as other neat stuff.

[Check it out](http://www.massively.com/2008/05/06/exclusive-vanguard-game-update-5-preview/)! And let me know if you liked the videos... or if you have any suggestions for better cheap (or free) video editing software that can deal with the Fraps codec and 1680x1050 video.
