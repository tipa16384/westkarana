# Returning to Shapeshifter

With the original [Neopets](http://neopets.com) founders talking up [their new company and their new game](http://www.massively.com/2008/07/02/neopets-founders-announce-a-new-mmo/), I decided to go back and check out how my Xweetok was doing in the older game.

Hungry and dying. Poor Spitefur. I'd been ignoring her since I won Shapeshifter last April. That triumph was my final goal in Neopets, and I had no reason to go on... and yet this morning found me walking through Neopia again, looking at the sights, browsing the games, and oh dear, who IS that Ixi in the corner? With that game of hers?

Sigh. So I started up Shapeshifter again. I always feel a little like [Ragle Gumm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Out_of_Joint) as I set up the scripts and programs that solve the puzzles for me. I tore through the first 19, where I had to stop, as I'd reached the maximum number of Neopoints I could earn from that game in a day.

81 more puzzles to go... and they are about to get quite a bit harder.

Meteor Games, the new company, is hiring, by the way. A nice variety of jobs... but you have to work in West Hollywood. LA? Thanks, but no thanks.
