#Wizard 101's "Extended Downtime" -- Grizzleheim on Test?#

Re: this message from Wizard 101, the extended downtime might possibly have something to do with pushing Grizzleheim to the test server, but who knows?


> Wizard101 Extended Maintenance

Wizard101 the game will be offline for maintenance for an extended period of time.
