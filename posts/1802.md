[Aeria "of course we will publish your free-to-play MMO for you" Games](http://aeriagames.com) has just announced that their free-to-play Diablo-like, [Cronous](http://cronous.aeriagames.com/), has just entered closed beta. More news later after I have had a chance to take a look, or [sign up for the beta](http://cronous.aeriagames.com/) and see for yourself :)

Guild Wars FTW!
