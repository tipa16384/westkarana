Trion has announced the third beta event for their Rift MMO. It's been described as an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary game, and that seems about right. Like fantasy novels, I guess, where very few ever try anything new, and yet people still buy, read and enjoy them.

It's a decent genre entry, and as I don't currently play any games in the fantasy MMO genre, I'm very much looking forward to it. (Wizard101 is so entirely different that it cannot be compared to the WoW-likes in any way. That's what I love about it!)

In this third event, beta testers will be able to play both Defiant and Guardian characters. While the test description doesn't specifically mention PvP, in the beta world, the newbie areas for both factions meet -- and I expect to see some action there.

The official goal for the current test is simply to help seal a rift. That won't take long, so players will have plenty of chances to try the things they haven't gotten to in the previous tests. We've been promised more training points to play with.

~~It's important to note that the NDA is back in effect for this third test.~~ This was an error on the part of the Rift team, there is no NDA for this or any other beta test (see comments).
