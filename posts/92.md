# The Dirty Thirties

![](../images/sporeking.jpg)

Nashuya fighting the Spore King in the Ark of Harclave solo adventure. They give you a heroic buff which allows you to take on groups of yellow heroic mobs and bosses, like this guy.

She hit thirty by the finish; and a couple of days ago, Etha hit thirty alchemy; and a little further back, Dera made 30 and then 31... so a lot of my characters are mid way through. Of course, SOE is just about to raise the level limit.

I find I fear commitment, in games as in life. I like chatting with people and being around them in game, but I am less and less inclined to trust them enough to group with them.

Did some WoW server shopping today; looked at Hyjal, but though they're PST, they say they're crowded and lag is horrid. WarcraftRealms.com said they were they least-populated PvE PST server... sigh...

It *was* funny to read the laments of EST people that the raids started so late for them! Made me smile.

Logged on to EQ when I got home. They were in Anguish and the waiting list was at 18. So I logged back out, went back to Splitpaw as I'd meant to. Would have done more but some real-life stuff had me outside talking to police for an hour or so.

And wouldn't you like to know more about that :P
