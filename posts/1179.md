#The Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale#

Dungeon Siege is my "oh my god, I have no internet connection" game on my laptop. When I saw what looked to be a cheesy generic fantasy flick trailer on the TV this weekend, I had no desire to go (Eragon cured me of that) (and yes, I've been told the book was way better). Then it ended with the title: "[In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460780/)".

Oh dear. A movie based on a game I actually played? I managed to resist Super Mario Bros, Double Dragon, Mortal Kombat, Doom, Silent Hill and dozens of others because I hadn't played the games.... but now I feel kinda obligated to go.

It's directed by famed schlockmeister [Uwe Boll](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uwe_boll). What could possibly go wrong?
