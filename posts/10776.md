During work today, I'd log into Google+ and read about the adventures my friends who were stuck at home were having in SimCity. Weather is cruddy here tonight, and the thing I was going to go to tonight has been moved to next Thursday, and I looked forward to some SimCity time!

But nope. There was a patch, a restart, and then ----- nothing. Nothing nothing nothing. I thought the contest to send in your "best cities!!!!!" was hilarious, but... here's mine.

My best city to date. Like it? I love it!

Friday, Europe gets to experience the modern day thrill of not being able to play the single player game they thought they were buying.

Enjoy!
