Well, I guess that's something at least.



Angry with myself for not getting things done today. However, I did write a ASP page for our Saturday Sale results. It came out pretty well, but I had a lot of trouble with the connection string. In the end, I just copied the table into a place IIS could find it. I'll try to find a better solution when Felix comes back.



Tonight is a CE off night, so I should probably take this time to do some shopping and clean the house a little. I know Nostromo is getting tired of canned food. I'll probably play WoW when I sit down to game. I don't know if I can face the CE officers yet, after what happened yesterday.



I really need to get the following things done ASAP: find out if my new credit card arrived; call the repair shop so I can bring the car in for an estimate, order new checks, and pay the electric bill.
