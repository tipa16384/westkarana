#Wizard 101: Money for nothing.#

Christmas has come to Wizard City and Felix Navidad is selling Santa suits in Olde Town for real cash.

Someone please explain the sense of selling appearance clothing, like Santa suits, when you don't have appearance slots? Pi Story sells appearance armor -- has appearance slots. Dream of Mirror Online -- sells appearance armor, has appearance slots. Every game that has statless appearance armor for sale for real cash, has APPEARANCE SLOTS so you can still wear your regular gear and not have to swap out all the time.

As it is now, buying the appearance armor from the various holiday merchants that crop up is just throwing real money away for the sake of the one screen shot you're going to take of yourself dressed.

At least it will keep the trunk in your dorm room from getting chilly.

The various wands on offer are kinda neat, all cast a 50 point Ice spell, but since I'd hardly put aside my swords (yes, got another one awhile ago) for them, they aren't worth anything to me. But might be to someone who needs another wand, and why not choose a cool looking one?

Pets sold for the holiday include the decorated evil snowman I have with me (yup, I'll buy pets), and an elf (like the ones that cheerfully cast those annoying DoTs on you in battle) dressed as one of Santa's Little Helpers (not the dog!).

Best pet is still the black cat sold at Hallowe'en, which adds a no-fizzle black cat spell to your deck. The Christmas pets don't add anything.

Afterward, I went and soloed the Shiritaki Temple instance again for old time's sake -- well, I'd made a really cruel short deck and wanted to try it out. Worked great. The Plague Oni dropped ONE item, and it was a pair of cruddy boots I couldn't even wear. Sigh.

No news about Dragonspyre in the December newsletter, but they do have the concept art for it in their new Wizard Store.

The Wizard Store, btw, is kinda cool. You can get SNEAKERS with the symbol for your school on them! As well as other stuff. Parents with kids who play -- do NOT let them [look at the store](http://www.zazzle.com/Wizard101)! Just pick out one or two things for them while they're sleeping.

I haven't played W101 in a few weeks, and it was fun to go back and do an instance with a new strategy and have it work so well, but at the end, there was still no Dragonspyre, no quests in my notebook, no appearance slots... so I logged out again. I'll check in again next month, maybe try for my boots off Plague Oni once more.
