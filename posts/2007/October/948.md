# EQ2: The crows come home to roost

This was all part of our "execution strategy". Carefully arrange ourselves *beneath* him, with our weapons all pointed up, then when he gets tired and lands, WHAM! Death of a thousand needles, we rez and we loot.

It was *just crazy enough to work.*

Okay, we really didn't think we were going to roll in their with twelve eleven random people and kill Xux'liao (yeah, I looked up his name...), but given we'd just spent a night getting access to the place, seemed worth a look.

And didn't I just know I'd be asked to bring my Inquisitor... well heck, she does 380 dps -- not bad for an alt, though raid geared inquisitors can do 1K dps and still heal -- but it was fun. A plate healer hat dropped off a mini-named along the way and the templar in the raid either had it or didn't want it, so I got it.

We learned a lot about the boss fight. I learned, for instance, that keeping my group alive would take all my time. Finding a way to avoid the boss' AE will be key to killing him. And we needed loads more dps.

We developed a lot of the strats for the wing nameds that other groups and guilds would copy. As for long time friends, well, they're either in EQ1 or WoW now. I'd love to play with friends, but EQ2, like EQ1 before it, just feels like home now. You always go back home.\r\n\r\nEQ2 is really an excellent game; there's always SOMETHING new to do.
