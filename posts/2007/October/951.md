# Running Dungeons

Since not playing since the Dungeon Runners beta, I figured it was time to give it another shot. It gives me that WoW experience -- cartoon characters with huge weapons and armor, humor, ability to solo, fast levels and quick upgrades and the occasional group -- far cheaper.

Free's cheap, right? Though I went ahead and paid the $5 for the membership package, which includes being able to stack potions, use the bank, and wear/wield the best stuff.

Dungeon Runners is an MMO stripped to the bone. You have one main town -- Townston (though you can port to the newbie town and, once you've discovered it, the base camp for Algor's Terror-Dome... and likely others I haven't seen yet). You have two main dungeons -- Algernon and the group-oriented Hellish Dungeon of Doom -- and each of these have myriad sub-dungeons, which themselves could have dungeons off them.

In fact, the main industry of those in the Townston area is making and filling dungeons. That's what the NPCs in Townston *do*. Only sometimes the monsters they import get a little more rambunctious than they were hired to be, and that's where the quests come in.

See, the dungeons were *supposed* to be filled with what they call "fodder" -- numberless minions, easy to kill and not that dangerous. Trust the more intelligent monsters to see what was going on in Townston and start invading the dungeons themselves in order to trap and kill unsuspecting adventurers who *thought* they were just coming down for a good time and that was *that*.

It's all good fun, the game doesn't take itself seriously and even the boss monsters themselves, interlopers that they are, aren't that tough. The dungeons and loot scale to your level and the size of your group, so for the best loot imaginable, group up with a couple of people around your level and head into Algernon. Or just go solo. The game will adjust so that no matter how you like to play, it's okay.

There are half a dozen servers, one of which is PvP, another one of which is members only, but even the most popular server had just a few hundred people at peak (like EQ2, it spins off instances if things get too crowded). You can log into any server and your characters will follow.

Quick play, wicked sense of humor... for fast, cheap fantasy MMO fun, you can't go much wrong with Dungeon Runners. It's earned a permanent place on my hard drive.
