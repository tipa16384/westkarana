# Playing together alone

*Posted by Tipa on 2007-03-10 10:55:47*

From [Raph Koster's notes on GDC](http://www.raphkoster.com/2007/03/09/gdc-07-game-studies-download/)... a stunning insight into the innovation WoW brought to the MMO realm... given the chance, players only group less than a third of their playtime and for the vast bulk of their playtime, like playing solo, but still chatting and being part of the community.

This is why I hardly play EQ1 anymore. Sitting LFG for three to four hours just to get a horrid pickup group because as a cleric there were no other options took all the fun from the game.

In WoW, EQ2 and LotRO... I can be part of the world without having to be part of a group. And that's the takeaway lesson here.

> From the PARC guys. Q: why do players spend so much time playing alone? Players who said they were playing for others, were actually not doing so. They only play with others 30% of the time. The rest,they played alone. Players favoried the soloable classes by a high degree. 56% of WoW players are not guilded. Or if they are, they are the sole member. So, thereâ€™s a new middl ground to social play. They take the gamers are their word, but gamers get the benefits form shared presence, little or now directed interaction. Playing â€œtogether alone.â€ Any MP game can take advantage of this middle ground.
