Yeah you, the guy who loses it to largo. Schizo for scherzo. Tantrums for tarantellas. Sawing away at the air cello through the entire winter concert season.

Take the symphony home with you!

Cello Hero brings the symphony to your living room!



Greatest hits from four centuries of cello's finest! Bach! Bann! Bantock! Bax!

Solo play or gather a dozen friends for multiplayer ensemble action! Or tab a friend for cello duels a la Dutilleux!
