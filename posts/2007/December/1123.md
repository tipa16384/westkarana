# OMG Blizzard merged with Activision!

I don't care, but I just felt I should say something about it.

Genj, comments?

Edit: Actually, I guess I do have a observation: Aside from making shag rugs from hundred dollar bills, life at Blizzard must be pretty tough. What the heck do you do for a second act? Their next MMO has to do better than World of Warcraft, or it will be seen as a failure. Ten million subscribers in the first week, or blogs and game sites around the world will have "Blizzard has LOST IT! HA HA!" as their headlines.

Any other MMO company can get subscription numbers in the 500,000 range and be seen as very successful. If Blizzard launches a Starcraft (let's say) MMO and only gets 500,000, heads will roll, layoffs will commence, red-faced executives will be paraded in front of the shareholders to try and explain themselves.

They had to find a way out of that trap. Perhaps this merger gives them a way to release new games with more realistic expectations.
