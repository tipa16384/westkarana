# DOMO: Sorry, I have to post this...

This game just turns the cute -- I mean, the *kawaii* -- up to 11... So after you choose your life's destiny, all very solemn, your Mirror King (who's a girl, but let's not quibble) sends you off to find a World Mirror that will set you on your path (I chose: monster friend). But before you go... PICTURES! YAY! PLLLLLEEEEEEASE JUST ONE PICTURE!

So she tiredly, resignedly, agrees to let you take some pictures, and you and she do some poses.

Come on... how cute is that :) And I can catch little cute creatures and save them to use later, like Pokemon! Wheee!

(World looks different than previous screenie because I amped all their display settings just for fun).

**Tipa** writes: Yes, Dream of Mirror Online. It was pretty crowded when I was on last night, though important plot events (like this one) remove the other people from the screen (who would have been all over normally, since this scene takes place around a crowded fountain in the center of a city). In this, it's a lot like Final Fantasy XI Online, which would do the exact same thing. Your view of the world in both games may not be the same as someone else's, depending on how far into the quest line you were.

I'll get some shots with other people in them tonight :) I had just finished this when my son came to invite me into a Rock Band group, and when that was over, I went to EQ2 for the rest of the night. But up until then, my time in DOMO was in the newbie village, where I was the only person.

Almost to level 10, where I get to choose my job.

And, hopefully, get some pants...

*strokes beard*

Interesting. Mayhaps I'll have to give it a look.

**Zygwen** writes: Don't forget to get your Chokemon in eq2 too.

**Tipa** writes: I have my Chokemon on my bruiser, Winterwing :) I wonder, can other nameds also be caught, like the named brute and wyvern in KP? The Chokeball seller implied I could find more Chokemon all over Kunark.

Cameron: The magic mirrors in which you catch monsters give you a monster egg that you can release later; but once you use it, it's gone, so it's not exactly like Pokemon.

**Zygwen** writes: I haven't done the Chokemon quest but there is a non agro Chokekai near Chardok and a named one not far from there too. There is a post on the SoE forums about the Chokemon I haven't read it recently but they where trying to track down the other Chokemon.

**Lishian** writes: @Zygwen Do you have a toon named Zygwen on Nagafen? I'm pretty sure I pvp'ed a Zygwen the other night.

**Lishian** writes: > Pants are so over ratedâ€¦

Yeah, I don't wear pants.

---

**Zygwen** writes: Nope. I don't pvp. As far as I know, there is still only one Zygwen in EQ2. eq2players is known to be out of date by a day or two though.

**MrrX** writes: Haha, that looks just too cute not to at least check out.
