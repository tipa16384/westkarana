# PotBS: There is only One True Pirate Server

*Posted by Tipa on 2007-12-27 18:42:41*

I saw that Keen & Graeve posted the [list of North American and European servers](http://www.keenandgraev.com/?p=658) for Pirates of the Burning Sea.

And this very same day comes word on Slashdot that Antigua (one of the PotBS-NA servers) has been [given permission by the World Trade Organization](http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/12/27/1514235) to infringe American copyrights up to $21 million a year.

Pirates, and future Pirates: Welcome to your new home :) Now go be nice boys and pillage quietly!
