Once a month, the Buzzkillaz come together from their solo gigs to rock the world. And the world is rocked and it is rolled. Today they formed, for perhaps the last time, to do a benefit concert, one legendary evening, one endless setlist.

58 songs.

No stopping.

No intermissions.

No replacements.

Janet, lead guitar, played by Genjer. Punk sensibility mixed with old-school style. Her guitar is a holy relic.

A ndrew, drummer and band leader, played by me (but dressed by Drew). He doesn't care if you think he's gay. He doesn't even know himself. But his 'sticks beat a rhythm as steady as the ticking of a cesium clock in the detonator of a bomb that will blow your minds.

Reiko, lead singer. She only comes out at night, and her face might be the last thing you see. But you'll meet your end smiling. Played by Jazz. Her magic microphone is named Charlotte.

Kendall, bass, played by Drew but dressed by me. Every day with him is a new beginning. His bass will make you comfy and serve you tea on cold winter mornings.

58 songs. Six and a half hours. And one broken bass guitar.

Yeah... the strum bar broke about 40 songs in. But this isn't the kind of thing you do more than once. This was the controller that came with Rock Band. Played hard? Just crappy? Who knows? We babied it through the remaining songs, everyone saving their overdrive to rescue poor Kendall... that was the only axe he had. At Highway Star, Jazz took over the bass and Drew moved to vocals. Song by song we inched through. Green Grass and Home... that was a tough one. We lost a lot of fans over the ten minute guitar and bass duet. Step by step. Last song... FINALLY... The Who's "Won't Get Fooled Again"... pounding those drums left and right and up and down, those things took a hell of a beating and we came screeching to a triumphant halt.

We'd done it. We'd lost over 100,000 fans due to the bass. But those that remained got a show to remember.

Buzzkillaz. You been buzzed.

It's always been hard to strum - when I used it during a prior visit I had to pound it with the palm of my hand at times in order to strum it hard enough for it to work. And being that you found out that pleny others have had the same problem with the guitar that comes with the rock band set - it's not that we rocked so hard, it's that the guitar is just that crappy. 

So now who do we write to to have more Queen songs available for the game? Love me some Freddy Mercury - overbite and all! Imagine Jazzmin having to sing "bohemian rhapsody"? lol
