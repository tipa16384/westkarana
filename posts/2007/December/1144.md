# POVRay Models

*Posted by Tipa on 2007-12-08 08:41:35*

Hi; this page publishes my Persistence of Vision (POVRay) models. POVRay is a free, widely used, ray tracing and rendering program. All files here are hereby in the public domain; please use them however you like. I'd love to see what you've done with them!

The first is the Weighted Companion Cube from Valve's amazingly fun game, Portal. The file "wccscene.pov" renders the image below; "wcc.pov" is the Weighted Companion Cube alone.
