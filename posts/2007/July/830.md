'Twas near the eleventh hour of yesterday before the Owl dropped a package at my door. "I hope you have your reading glasses!", quoth she, unusually talkative (for an Owl).

I tapped it twice with my wand. "*Capsa Adaperio!*" The box flew open

Inside was the tome for which I had waited so long, as well as an advertisement for a Muggle cinema and a flyer for Microsoft Vista, undoubtedly placed there by a Death-Eater in the employ of Owl Mail.

I started to read. The sun faltered and weakened as the dark tale unfolded. At last, I could bear it no longer. I paced the room, my heart distraught. If only I had Dumbledore's wisdom with me now! For a moment, I thought I caught a glimpse of his bright, clear, blue eyes, and a word came to me -- "Scones!"

Scones? Wasn't that the name of Ron's rat? No, that was Scuppers. Who was the evil Pettigrew in disguise! No, Dumbledore would never mention that name to me. Maybe I should make some...?

So I made some scones. They were just the sort of thing needed for the long night ahead.

Mmmm.... scones, Diet Coke, and a good book. Heaven!

I didn't have the strength to finish it all in one sitting, and reluctantly, went to bed.

I spent the morning lost once more in the book. The search, the surprises, the betrayals and the heroism... It didn't end as I expected; in fact, I think maybe it was entirely different than I thought. But I won't say another word, except to have pity on my poor cat...

The final battle (well, of course there is one!) was so beyond imagination that a *Immobilus* curse sprang from the pages of the book and good Isis was right in the way.

She's better now.

Wow, you finished that book already?! Amazing! Sorry about your Vista woes. :(

I need to show you a pic of Hoppkins cat. Our cats will be like the 3 Muskateers! :P 

Miao!
