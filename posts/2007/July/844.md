# The Oyster Boys vs the Space Truckers

*Posted by Tipa on 2007-07-30 10:29:13*

Blue Oyster Cult opening for Deep Purple here in Connecticut? Brilliant! This will be my fifth time seeing BOC, but the first for Deep Purple.

This will be the first time for my son; this is the first time I haven't seen BOC in a bar, and he's never been 21 in his life.

I know BOC will play their mega-hits, and I know as well that they'll open with the main theme to Blade Runner leading into "Stairway to the Stars"... I hope they skip "In Thee" this time. Songs I want to hear: "Astronomy" (duh), "Last Days of May" (sigh), ""When the Old Gods Return" (pleeeeease!), "Harvest Moon" (still luv ya, Buck!)... and if they do "Godzilla", I hope Eric gives it a BIG lead in. They only did "Take Me Away" once since I've seen them, but I loved the opening Eric did for that one as well. Oh, I dunno... I'll love whatever they do... oh yeah, "Veterans of the Psychic Wars", please. I know it's cliche, but its a crowd pleaser. "Cities on Flame", "Seven Screaming Dizbusters"... they did "Golden Age of Leather", complete with the *a capella* opening, once...

Gah... I know they won't do anything off of "Imaginos" (aside from 'Astronomy' and 'Subhuman', which were on "Secret Treaties"), and I *hope* they don't do anything from "Club Ninja", and if they want to do something off "Revolution by Night", they better clear the song with me ahead of time. I'd love to hear at least a couple tracks from "Heaven Forbid" -- they played a couple last time, but since they are opening for Deep Purple, who knows how much time they will have to do anything besides their hits?

I'm not driving all the way down to New Haven for "Don't Fear (the Reaper)" and "Burnin' For You"...

For Deep Purple, hmm... well, I always liked "Lazy" and "Hush". I know my son likes "Smoke on the Water" (doesn't everyone?) and they're certain to play that. I wonder what their current lineup is.

No Jon Lord, no Ritchie Blackmore, but they do have Steve Morse on lead guitar -- he's good, I have one of his solo albums and a couple Dixie Dregs disks, so it should be good. Still, I think they're stretching it to call this lineup "Deep Purple". But I guess that's what people said about BOC when the Bouchards left.

Though they have Eric (lead vocals, stun guitar), Buck (vocals, lead guitar) and Joe (keyboard, vocals, guitar) still...

As for BÃ–C original members, Joe Bouchard left in '86, Tipa. Allen Lanier, original BÃ–C keyboardist/guitarist, retired at the beginning of this year. Bassist Richie Castellano moved over to Allen's role, where he's been great, and long time rocker Rudy Sarzo (Quiet Riot, Whitesnake, Ozzy) joined the band on bass. I've seen this line-up five times this summer, and they're smokin' hot!

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: Agh, I meant Allen. I knew the Bouchards left ages ago. Sorry to hear he retired, though :(

Can't wait to see them again. I haven't seen them since... must be at least ten years, I saw them in Santa Cruz.

Okay, don't tell me their opener, but please do tell me... anything from the newer albums?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days\_on\_the\_Green

As I recall, a young(er) Ozzy Osbourne opened in one of his early solo tours featuring the one and only (and soon to be no longer, sniff) Randy Rhoads.

Ah, nostalgia...

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: Sounds like a heck of a show. Wish I'd been there!

Best festival-concert I've been to was one headlined by Phish, with Mother Hips, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Four Non Blondes, Meat Puppets and a couple others on the bill -- at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey, CA.

According to the Wikipedia article, the night I went with my friend Susan to see "An Evening with Pink Floyd" (while they were on their PULSE tour), was technically a "Day on the Green", though not called that.

I miss living in Northern California! Southern California was really yucky in comparison.

I'm still going down, down, down from the last trip.

Well - I better get my rainbow boogie going and get back to work.

Band I used to be in. I played flute, recorder and pennywhistle.

Three of the four people in the band now were there when I was in it, which gives them a better record than Deep Purple.
