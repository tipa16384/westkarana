# EVE: Okay, so you've been podded... NOW what do you do?

*Posted by Tipa on 2007-07-18 13:44:16*

Why, you do a [Pod-cast](http://alaph.net/?p=369), of course!

One Tired Eve Pilot... limping from battle... sensors on the blink... never sees the asteroid wot got 'im... dispatches from the clone bank...

Good luck :)

For a pirate like Alaph, "I Pod" might be more appropriate :)

I'm thinking a pirate like Alaph should name a podcast "I Pod" :)
