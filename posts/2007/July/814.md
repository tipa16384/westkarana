Have to respect a MMO that gives you their logo in handy Photoshop format :)

Just a brief pointer to the game... the last time I looked at Hero's Journey, they were looking for volunteers to write quests, design levels, and run live events. I don't know where they are with things -- their web site says they will release this year -- but if they can pull it off, they will be one of the most community-friendly MMOs I've seen. Design your own look -- the look of your armor is independent of its stats -- write your own quests, run your own live events...
