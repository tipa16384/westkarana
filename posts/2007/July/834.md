# I think I am going to have to delete Vista...

My laptop came installed with Windows Vista Home Premium.

I tried. God, how I tried. But I am sick to death of it. I can't find anything. In the name of security, it squirrels things like screenshots away where they cannot be found -- not by its "search", anyway, which refuses to look everywhere even if you *choose* "Everywhere". You can find things by hand that search will never show you.

Drivers don't work. Games don't work. Ventrilo doesn't work right if I have EQ2 on top -- never had trouble with it under XP. EQ1 doesn't work (I know other people have gotten it to work with "run as admin" and "windows xp sp2 compatibility" but trust me, I know about those and have tried them).

All I do with the machine is play games and sometimes browse the web. I use my Linux machine for everything else. So of those simple, easy things I need the machine to do -- it cannot.

Time to scrape that crap from the laptop and put XP on it.

I gave it my best shot.
