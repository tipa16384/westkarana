# STO: Sex Gods of Sol III

*Posted by Tipa on 2007-02-01 12:52:41*

There's a race in the Star Trek universe with a racial ability so amazing, so irresistible, that when I read a thread about [racial choices in Star Trek Online](http://www.startrek-online.net/messageboard/showthread.php?t=5441), I just had to add my thoughts on the compelling qualities of this mystical race.

Theirs is the power of sexual attraction. Betazoids? Well, they're telepathic and get married in the nude and have a tendency toward skintight cat suits with plunging necklines, but no... even Deanna Troi's family fell prey to them. Even unemotional Vulcans. Heck, even xenophobic Romulans.

These intergalactic paramours? Humans.

They drip sex appeal. Maybe it's their smooth foreheads, or their round ears. I think it's pheromones of some sort. Half Vulcans, half Klingons, half Cardassians, half Romulans, three quarters this, five-eighths that with humans bringing them all together. Humans have the racial ability to sleep with anyone or anything and make babies.
Let's be honest here. The galaxy isn't ready for humans.
