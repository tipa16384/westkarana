This game just turns the cute -- I mean, the *kawaii* -- up to 11... So after you choose your life's destiny, all very solemn, your Mirror King (who's a girl, but let's not quibble) sends you off to find a World Mirror that will set you on your path (I chose: monster friend). But before you go... PICTURES! YAY! PLLLLLEEEEEEASE JUST ONE PICTURE!

So she tiredly, resignedly, agrees to let you take some pictures, and you and she do some poses.

Come on... how cute is that :) And I can catch little cute creatures and save them to use later, like Pokemon! Wheee!

(World looks different than previous screenie because I amped all their display settings just for fun).
