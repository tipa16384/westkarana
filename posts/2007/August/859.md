# Neopets: Fire Faerie Quest Completed

*Posted by Tipa on 2007-08-11 08:01:27*

Random quests in Neopets have some odd repercussions.... like not being able to use the Shop Wizard to search for items to, say, finish the quest...

.... so I went to the auction house... cheap scarf there, and maybe I'll win it, but I decided to browse through some player shops and found a scarf for 13,000 NP. I had no idea if that was a good price or not, but I couldn't find it in any NPC shops, so I bought it.

Now that I could use the Shop Wizard again, I found they usually sold for more like 3000 NP.... I feel like such a sucker now...

Oh well.... back to the dungeons....
