# Those lazy fire faeries...

So, my Neopet, Spitefur the Xweetok, was running around doing all his morning chores, when while at the Shrine of Colzac, a fire faerie appeared and demanded Spitefur find her scarf.

Come ON! She's a FIRE FAERIE! What the heck does she need a scarf for? Sheesh.

And even worse, the Shrine gave me nothing today.

I think it's burned out.

I blame the faerie.

**Tipa** writes: Oh, you'd like Faerie Island, then. Dark faeries, Light faeries, Ice faeries, Tooth faeries (yes, really...) I mostly go for the free healing and (of course) The Wheel of Excitement.\r\n\r\nMy favorite bit in Neopets so far has been the RPG you can play. It's you, playing your Neopet, playing an RPG.\r\n\r\nOh, Lish -- I made a haffer fury (named Tipa) on Nagafen last night. She's still on the island. I think I will betray my inkies, though, so I can make my spells and gear.\r\n\r\nÂ

Instead of scarves, they get spiked collars.\r\n\r\n@TIPA Send tell to Chapathy or Lish (my toons that I am on mostly). I'll friend you and send you a tell if i see you as well. Between me and the guildies, we should be able to craft just about anything. Time to start farming for Tipa.
