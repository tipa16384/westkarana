> "The screenplay is attributed to three writers. That means if the film's funny parts were divided evenly among them, they each wrote zero."


From Eric D. Snider's [review](http://www.ericdsnider.com/movies/daddy-day-camp/) of "Daddy Day Camp".

Not that I was planning on seeing it anyway :P Andy and I are going to see Stardust tonight, though... Neil Gaiman... how could that be anything but wonderful?

Ranks up there with Willow, Princess Bride, and Baron Munchausen in the fairy-tale/comedy/fantasy genre. \r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.nelsonguirado.com/index.php/reviews/2007/08/11/movie_review_stardust_best_film_of_the_y" rel="nofollow">Full review</a>

**Tipa** writes: Same category; Princess Bride is better, but Stardust is well worth seeing, maybe even a few times.
