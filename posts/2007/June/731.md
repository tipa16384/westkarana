Unfortunately, I was at work and couldn't log in to snag the AA heroically defeat the terrible beast.

We haven't yet found any games as fun as Wii Sports, which came with it, but we're still looking. However, Sports is amazing fun. My niece is the bowling pro, my sister is tops at golf, my son is a tennis maven and me, well, I'm okay at tennis and my bowling isn't too bad. Zelda Twilight Princess was boring, and that Sonic party game we bought was a waste of money.
