**Tipa** writes: It isn't that expensive if you don't live right IN Monterey. Seaside (which borders it and was once part of Monterey -- East Monterey -- is very affordable). We lived in Marina, about four miles from Monterey, but still on the Bay and still beautiful.

I didn't leave because of housing costs. I left because I couldn't find work :/ And now it really WOULD be hard to get back (unless I could find work there now, somehow).

I never wanted to move to Silicon Valley. Maybe I should have. At least I would still have been in the area.
