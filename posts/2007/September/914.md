# Here's something to try...

Why hasn't anyone written a MUD based on Wiki technology? Seems like a natural fit.

I was a master glasscrafter, a title I obtained after an apprenticeship in glasscrafting (ie, I learned the tools to build rooms and objects and the restrictions placed upon them) and the sudden departure of the old master glasscrafter to regions unknown. Unfortunately, my time in Pern was coming to an end as well, and I didn't hold the post long.

A standard Wiki (I've given this some thought since I posted) isn't real-time -- people entering and leaving rooms and changing the state of room objects like doors, lights and what-not wouldn't work in the static environment of a Wiki page.

Still, take a basic engine, dress it up with some Ajax and some back-end support, and *BAM* a game anyone can write, just like it was 1994.
