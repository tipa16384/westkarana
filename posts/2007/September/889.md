# OMG BACK!!!!!!

*kisses ground*

I actually was starting another blog in case this one didn't come back. I will probably still find another host....

I'm on Facebook now, courtesy of my sister. Look me up, add me to your friend's list. I'm also in the LinkedIn professional network so... if you need to know my real name, lemme know.
