# EQ2: RoK Download Delays

*Posted by Tipa on 2007-11-13 16:14:24*

Just spoke with my son, and he tells me the patcher is reporting between 12 and 16 hours for the Rise of Kunark digital download. Those of you who were in the beta may be able to just copy some or most of the files over (especially the paks).

If you ordered the digital download, and weren't in the beta, you may be settling in for a long wait.

**Edit: BETA TESTERS -- if you copy your "paks" and "Music" folder from the BetaEQII folder to your EverQuest II folder, you'll save hours of download time.**
