Today, the dentist finished off my root canal, the first snow of the season fell here in Connecticut, and, oh yeah, Rock Band came out.

My son there is the drummer!

I still haven't sat down and figured out how to use an old Netgear wireless router to bridge to our main D-Link. I don't know why Microsoft couldn't just have included WiFi in their console like Sony and Nintendo did. Even on their PORTABLE consoles.\r\n\r\nVoice doesn't go over the internet. And I am hearing full band mode isn't supported over the internet? HUH? I'll have to check this out when I get home. And kick my son off the drums. He says they are VERY HARD in medium.\r\n

**cyanbane** writes: The drums are VERY HARD on Easy!\r\n\r\nIt seems like the "Rock band Central" was extremely busy or just laggy or something, I ended up getting on it to check out the leaderboards but didn't experiment with online play.\r\n\r\nThe game as a whole is absolutely awesome though.

First, the microphone wouldn't work. The Harmonix site told me that the microphone AND the normal Xbox wireless controller were sympatico, and that I needed both to be present. And then, I played the vocals on medium. Some I did okay with. Some were absolutely so bad, my son had to "save" me (for which he earned the kudo "Band Savior"). After a break, we reformed with me on lead guitar and he on bass. Since he originally was the Band Leader on drums, and we weren't using drums anymore, we had to make a NEW band fronted by a lead guitarist.\r\n\r\nA VERY fun game. We're waiting for the people downstairs to go to work or something so we can play again.
