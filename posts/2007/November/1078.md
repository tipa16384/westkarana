# Slow Glass

*Posted by Tipa on 2007-11-19 17:01:53*

Researches in Surrey, England, have discovered [how to slow light down](http://portal.surrey.ac.uk/press/1107/151107) and trap it in glass. I was immediately reminded of a story by one of the great Irish science fiction writers, [Bob Shaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Shaw), in his "Light of Other Days"; Slow Glass was glass that took months or years to pass light from one side to the other, and he crafted that idea into a short story of heartbreak and loss.

SciFi.com has the [entire short story here](http://www.scifi.com/scifiction/classics/classics_archive/shaw/shaw1.html)... I've loved it since the first time I read it.

I remember reading the story for the first time in an science-fiction oriented english class in high school in 1974 or 75.... 

I was truly a poignant story that provided a nice counterpoint to the other kinds of stories we were reading in the class.

I'll have to hit the SciFI.com link this weekend and read through it again - thanks for the reminder!!
