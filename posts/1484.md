#Bad week for gaming, good week for blogging#

I haven't done even a tenth of the gaming I usually do in a given week. Between my sister Hillary getting hitched in Boston; my sister Genjer and niece Jazzmin coming up from NYC to spend Easter weekend here in Connecticut; and the siren's call of Rock Band demanding the return of the (in)famous Buzzkillaz, well, that was pretty much it.

But though I didn't get much gaming done, I did get a lot of writing done. I am absolutely delighted to announce that I've been hired on at [Massively](http://massively.com) to do what I can to make Massively the number one destination for hot news and features about every single game in existence. I've patched Test and re-installed EQ1 because I can think immediately of three or four games which could use a lot more coverage, and I aim to see they get it.

I hope also to introduce Massively's readers to all the amazing bloggers whose sites I read every day. If you have some news you want to share with the world, [shoot me a note](mailto:brenda.holloway@weblogsinc.com) and I'll do my best to see it on Massively.

Nobody was more shocked than I when my application was accepted :P I was giddy for hours...

This is such a rush :) You'll notice a new "[Me @ Massively](http://www.massively.com/bloggers/brenda-holloway/)" link on the sidebar; this will point to my latest posts there.
