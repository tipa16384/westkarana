My Dragon Age: origins replay has been sucking away all my free time. But, that's done with, for now, so I just have to write about it.

Also, I changed the blog theme. Not 100% sure I like it, but I knew it was time to do something. You'll notice (perhaps) that the XFire plug in has been replaced by a Raptr widget; I've moved to Raptr for reasons I'll probably write about at some point.
