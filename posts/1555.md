# Nostalgia the Guild recruiting!

Hey! It's not too late to get in on one last romp through Norrath before it all blowed up! We're looking for a druid, cleric, berserker, monk or beastlord to fill out a second group. Check us out at [Nostalgia the Guild the Website](http://nostalgia.chasingdings.com)!

Requirements: EverQuest expansions up through The Buried Sea, an ability to play Friday nights at 7PM Eastern time on a regular basis, and a desire to experience EQ1 with friends as it was meant to be seen. We have a Vent server and SOE willing, may soon even have a guild :)

Leave a message on the website if you're interested. We're currently between levels 10 and 15, so there is no problem catching up.
