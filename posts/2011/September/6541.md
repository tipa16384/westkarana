I was on a quest last year for a Facebook game that was really a *game*, especially some sort of RPG. The great thing about Facebook games is that there are so \_many\_ of them, that there's bound to be a couple that appeal.

I fell pretty hard for Treasure Abyss, a whimsical RPG from gaming giant Namco Bandai that let you create a party formed from your character and those of your friends and kill dragons and other stuff. I sunk a lot of time and a fair bit of money into the game. I don't mind paying for games if I'm having fun.

After awhile, I moved on and so did Namco Bandai. Treasure Abyss development slowed; in the time since I stopped playing six months or so ago, they have added just one dungeon, a very short dungeon meant for new players. One new (hideously expensive) set of armor that can be worn by all classes, a couple new magician weapons and a daily lottery spin.

Even the most casual player would long have completed and left the game. Still, it's sad to see it close down.


> Dear Treasure Abyss Fans

After one year of good time with Treasure Abyss, we sadly announce that the page/game will be closing 30 September 2011. Item sale will finish on 9 September 2011.

I would have thought next to nix. Certainly I can atleast run a browser game for that much (of course, I'm not paying myself to code, granted)
