[After an hour, I still couldn't pick you out from the other babies. Wrinkled, wet, head shaped weird, crying... I'd seen it before](http://massively.joystiq.com/2011/01/04/rift-beta-events-impressions-from-the-staff/). 

I'm thinking this whole baby nonsense has run its course. There's plenty of adults around that can drive cars, climb trees, and feed themselves. I can't really see what a baby that can do none of these things brings to the table.

Other parents are telling me to give you some time, you'll grow into something unique and special. But frankly, I'm not buying it. It's been an hour and I'm bored with you already.

You're just the same as every other damn baby out there.
