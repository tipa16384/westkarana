# Wizard101: Grandmaster Gardener

After the couple of weeks at Master Gardener, I didn't expect to get to Grandmaster Gardener quite so soon. It was those Silver Trumpet Vines that did it; 300 xp per harvest, 3000 xp when they went elder, and I had four of the plants, the only remainders of my once-flourishing garden. I had a whole new plot picked out that has never seen a single seedling.

Now that leveling isn't a concern any more, I'll have to pick out plants for what they harvest. With all the pet snacks they've given, maybe I could finally level up one of my pets :)

If you are looking for snacks to level up pets (an activity that starts fun and becomes dull about 5.2 seconds later IMHO) I would recommend prickly bear cacti and baby carrots for their mega-snack-harvests.

P.S. I love your blog, it's a great one-stop shop for what's new in gaming today all around; not just one fantastic game but many. Thank you for doing what you do!
