Longasc and I were playing around on Tribble, Star Trek Online's test server, and he wanted to show me the new Vulcan science ship which will be flyable by players sometime next month. Couldn't find one, so he took me into a player-created mission that had one, but it was gone from there.

So I figured, well, we could just make a mission that had that ship in it, and fly around it and whatever, do what we liked. In fact, we BOTH could, and play each other's and... I started playing with the tools and though it would be really great if we could just get together, current STO players, and make an episode just for fun that we could share among each other. Maybe they'd have that new Vulcan ship, too.

So, here's the Foundry Challenge, for blog readers who also subscribe to Star Trek Online. 

Make a mission! And share it here. If it has the Vulcan cruiser D'kyr, even better! (I haven't been able to find it in the tools).

I should have mine ready by tomorrow. Its tentative title is "Ship in a Bottle".
