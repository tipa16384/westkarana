# TV Watch: Being Human (UK)

*Posted by Tipa on 2011-11-07 11:42:06*

I didn't expect that a series about a ghost, a vampire and a werewolf living together in a Bristol flat would actually be a really compelling drama. I just had this idea it could only be a comedy. "Being Human" is a really great show.  
  
Aaaaaand the home page contains a spoiler. Which I didn't know until I linked it.

**David Bates** writes: I agree +[Andy Parcell](https://plus.google.com/103007045855057150301) I didn't really enjoy the American version.. maybe it was because I HATE IT when american tv tries to remake (exactly) the british version.. I mean come on .. and syfy markets as a original series..   
  
I need to get the BBC version .. I think I'd like it more.. I've always liked the British versions better.. Steptoe and Son, Torchwood.. you know the good ones ;)

**Aaron Miller** writes: Does the American version go by the same name? I've noticed a *Being Human* series on Netflix, but skipped it because I assumed it was corny.

**David Bates** writes: Yup it sure does go by the same name.. I dunno.. I just couldn't get into the American Version.. it is on Syfy .. currently coming into it;'s second season.. and yes.. Bedlam is awesome sauce.. I have a bunch on my tivo I need to watch...

Hadn't heard of Bedlam; thanks for the tip!
