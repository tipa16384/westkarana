# Manchester Road Race: I'm so gonna die.

*Posted by Tipa on 2011-11-08 17:09:57*



After biking through the course for the Manchester Road Race this morning, I really have to hand it to the course designers. Sure, it would be nice if it weren't partially up the side of Mount Everest, but the steep ascent only lasts for the first couple of miles, after which there's a steep DOWNhill followed by a flat stretch of a couple miles and then another downhill race to the finish line.  
  
The hills at the start will separate the pack. The descent at the end means your friends and family see you coming down running. Even if you're a noob like me.  
  
Youtube automatically detected the eerily appropriate background music, oddly, and put up a link to buy the track. That's new. Does it make it okay that I used the track, then?**Google+:** [View post on Google+](https://plus.google.com/108460561201888322767/posts/fBGfQyEwJbH)
