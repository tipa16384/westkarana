# Wizard101 Mount Week Manta Ray winners! Bonus Contest!

*Posted by Tipa on 2011-04-08 21:41:08*

I received over 1,400 correct entries to my Manta Ray giveaway! That was a LOT! So, I guess the answer (A ARMY ANT) was pretty obvious, and maybe letting everyone see what everyone else answered made it REALLY easy but hey, I wasn't interested in giving the SAT here :)

Extra smiles to the people who said "ANT MARY"! I'm from New England and we pronounce "aunt", "ahhnt", so I didn't get the pun until several people pointed it out to me :) That was considered a correct answer as well.

The winners were (I have removed their host name to save them from spam):

Congratulations on your new MANTA RAY! E-Mails have been sent to each of you with your code. If you haven't gotten it, let me know. Check your spam folder! I tried not to use any words which would make the e-mail seem to be spam, but you never know.

I have ONE MORE CODE to give away! And I'm just going to put it right here in this post -- the first one to redeem it, gets it. Since everyone was asking for a hard contest, this last ray will go out to a master puzzle solver indeed. Don't ask for help or hints -- this is meant to be hard (at least I'd find it so if I were trying to solve it). I also won't know if someone guesses it and gets the ray unless someone tells me -- so if you solve it and get the fish, let me know!

~~Good luck! If you think you've got it, head to http://www.wizard101.com/promo and enter it to see if you've won. The code is 20 letters and digits long.~~

**The riddle was solved by Zitio (see comment below). Grats Zitio!**


> I am the beginning of all things. I can be found in hospitals, libraries and classrooms but never in orbit, underground or cafeterias (but booksellers know me well). I am the number of fingers on one hand, but not on two. If you know I hate thumbs, then you know how I count the fingers on two hands. I haven't failed, but almost missed the grade. Now that you know I hate thumbs, how many fingers on my left hand? I like tollbooths, swallows, and willows but not minnows, toboggans or bosses. Pie are round, but six are square. I like coral, teal and pearl but hate tin, tan and brown. Six are still square. Why isn't a woman an oman? How many hands, again? Why isn't a man an an? How many feet again? I love quizzes, quarries and Qatar, but I hate tests, pits and Kuwait. Call me 'sir' as I make this letter on the chessboard. I play games so poorly that all I ever see are a pair of crying eyes.
