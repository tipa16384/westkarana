# EQ: Fippy, Fippy wherefore art thou, Fippy

*Posted by Tipa on 2011-02-15 07:09:12*

Fippy Darkpaw isn't quite live yet, but he's in the server list. And as I scrolled -- yes, this list is so long that it scrolls -- through the list, it struck me how a near-twelve year old MMORPG has fifteen servers, one opening this very day, while far newer games like Vanguard and Warhammer Online are down to ~~one or two~~ far fewer.

The game designers for every new MMO can probably recite page after page of EverQuest's flaws. And yet EQ is still going strong while new games come and go.

Maybe they're doing something right?

I played way back in it's heyday and left after 4 years. I've always wished for another opportunity to play it all over again :-)

**Bhagpuss** writes: EQ didn't only just start a new server with Fippy, they started another new one last summer. No-one really seemed to know why - they did it right after the last round of server merges.

Fippy tomorrow for me. Just did three hours chasing Rifts just for the fun of it and now it's time for bed!
