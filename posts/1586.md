#EQ: All armored up!#

The leader of the Tuesday group said we should finish our racial armor quests before next week; I figured I'd get them out of the way today. A variety of wolf furs, various yellowjacket drops, and some iron bricks from goblins.

I started at around 6, finished at 11:30. OUCH. Okay, I thought that would go faster. I did take a couple of breaks. I peeked into the Bazaar to see if I could find any sort of shield that would work for me and wouldn't be considered twinked. But all of them, even the cheapest, were well beyond what we're allowed to use. Same for weapons. Even assuming I had that sort of cash... it would have just been too much.

I had a Lodizal shield on my cleric I wanted to hand to my paladin but that would just be the same thing. In the end, I camped the Shiny Brass Shield. And got a Ghoulbane along with it.

Shiny Brass Shield drops in Crushbone and Ghoulbane in Upper Guk (or via a quest in Butcherblock). How could I get them at the same time?

Well, nobody wants to camp Ghoulbane these days. The Upper Guk camp is tedious and will make your life pretty tough once you become KoS to live frogs. The quest is less tedious, but still involves a fair amount of camping, and is often broken. Oh, turns out there is an NPC in Felwithe that drops both the SBS and the Ghoulbane.

Now, he's not going to waste any time with a level 15 paladin. But against a 75 cleric... no chance. There was someone building faction by handing batwings to one the caster guildmasters, and the person came over to check out what I was doing. Well, since I was going to camp over to Sela once I'd killed it, and didn't want to get into a clickwar with a ninja looter, I zoned it and came back in a few minutes, did the deed, and Sela was well-geared.

Is it twinking? Yeah. But only a little. If Upper Guk groups existed, I could have camped it. If I felt like spending another four hours camping gray mobs, I could have got it that way. Instead, I got it by having a high level character get it for me. But this char is a tank. Befallen proved how bad things get when the tank isn't properly geared. The sword and shield are appropriate for her level, are necessary to hold aggro, and could easily have been (and probably was) worn by level 15-20 paladins seven years ago. This sort of thing would have been what you'd be expected to bring to a group, as a tank. People leveled far more slowly, and had a chance to camp their gear. Even a nostalgia guild can only take it so far.

I don't like bending the rules, so full disclosure here.

I did camp the armor components legit, though as the night wore on, I cared less and less about beating down mobs to make wasps spawn, and more and more about just getting it done ASAP. So I would gather up a dozen mobs and bring them to the guards at The Wall. When the guards had finished them off, I would bring more. And more. And then the wasps started coming back. Thanks guards :)

Shout out to Kuron, who finally finished his warrior epic 1.0 after what was it, six years? This nostalgia thing is pretty powerful! Big grats to the big guy. I dashed into the picture to show off my racial quest armor as well :)

Two days until Solusek's Eye! I don't want to have to tank with my ranger, but I bet I'll end up doing so. It'll still be fun :)
