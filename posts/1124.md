#CoV: Madame Scurry, Issue 11 baby#

While browsing Massively and reading the excellent article about the recent [City of Herollians Meet and Greet](http://www.massively.com/2007/12/03/impressions-of-the-cox-meet-n-greet/), I saw they mentioned "Willpower" and "Dual Blades" as very new, player-chosen powers, of which I knew nothing when I picked "Willpower" as the secondary power set for my Energy Stalker. The ability to never be seen by anything ever. I love "Hide", the first power in the "Willpower" set. I'm all like, "OH HAI, I IN UR BANK TAKING UR MONIES" in the Paragon City heist I soloed -- and I killed that stupid hero, Flambeau, after a couple of really minor deaths, but still failed the mission (and of course I got the money, too). Maybe I needed to get to an exit?

Anyway.

I guess that explains why there were so many dual-blade brutes running around. And it also explains why I couldn't find any build guides for Energy/Will Stalkers. Or in fact any mention of the power whatsoever.

Hiding, damage resistance and self-heals. Totally yum.
