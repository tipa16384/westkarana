#Okay, so they DO look ugly#

Looking back on my characters from around the time of the Velious expansion, I can see why people considered EQ1 a little hard on the eyes. I wonder if I can even remember who all these characters are.... some of them were on Fennin Ro, where I played with a couple of fellow Guides sometimes...

Front row - the shorties. Patience, my Fennin Ro cleric and currently a Bazaar mule on EMarr. She was still wearing that chain and bronze armor she bought from people killing dwarves in Butcherblock when I transferred her.

Tsuki, my mage and third character. She's currently on Stromm; I transferred her there to help Dera (now Brita) solo. I'd like to bring her back to EMarr.

Etha, my druid and second character and first SERIOUS character. Luclin changed her looks quite a bit.

Nina, my warrior. Look at that FULL CRAFTED! Ooooh! Aaaaah!

Tipa, my rogue. Back before she got dual wield! She would become my next main after Etha, eventually.

Back row: Nashuya, my SK. I think that armor is that Wakening Lands SK armor. I spent hours and hours camping that stuff.

Mehve, Erudite wizard - and my FIRST EVER EQ CHARACTER! Erudin was a happenin' place in those days. But you know, she was just TOO TALL.

Dulcet, Fennin Ro bard. My only male character. My role in groups was to pull, tank, dps, mana song, charm/mez adds, and piss off enchanters.

Some Fennin mage I do not remember...

And Prymat, whom I made first day Kunark came out. Can't remember what class she was.

Yay for trips down memory lane!
