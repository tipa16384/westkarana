# Spellborn: Two week warning!

If everything is still on schedule, Spellborn NV's "The Chronicle of Spellborn" should be out two weeks from yesterday, published in North American by Acclaim. I've heard nothing from Acclaim as to how to get the game; I imagine it will be a free-to-play download with a starting area, plus a massive full-game download if you choose to subscribe, but who knows?

It's looking like there will be no open beta, so the first time we'll be seeing it is when it's released. I don't know if they will be hosting the download themselves, or seeding it through FilePlanet.

Not a lot of info about the game itself, but there is [new lore and new screenshots](http://tcos.com/sbforum/viewtopic.php?t=15128&start=0&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight=) posted on the Spellborn website, dealing with two of the enemy factions. There's also a previous post that I missed dealing with targeting opponents in a game with no target locking via [The Reticule](http://www.tcos.com/en/content,105,combat_reticule.html) -- basically a cursor that changes depending on the range to your target and your active skill.

I've been waiting for this game so long that I have to admit to feeling less excited about it. You can only anticipate something so long, after all.
