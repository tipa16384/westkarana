It's just my duty to Norrath to fight back against the Void Tempests, but when I heard a reporter with the Befallen Banner shouting about some marvelous device in Neriak, well, I just had to turn in my shards and check it out. There was a gnome with shoulderpads that would have fit someone twice as wide. when i asked him about them, he said he didn't have a choice, that was the uniform, and the human who had worn it last had forgotten to re-adjust the shoulderpads and there just wasn't time and ... but you know, gnomes have those high, squeaky voices, so I excused myself and went inside.

Well, turns out some bug -- um, some Arasai -- had just invented a new lamp, but needed some bits of glowing fairy dust to activate it. I tried to separate the Arasai from his fairy dust, but he waved of my attack.

I sullenly looked for some fairy dust in Neriak, but apparently they clean up after themselves almost like real people. Darklight Woods -- no fairies! Nektulos Forest -- not far from the tunnel to Darklight Woods in the forest.... fairy heaven. I took care of the fairy problem AND filled the lantern with bits of fairy dust.

Twenty dead fairies later, the lamp shone with a deep yellow glow. I returned to Neriak, and the bug graciously allowed me to keep the lamp, and even gave me some Steaming Jumjum Pie! I was so happy! The gnome from the Banner interviewed me, and when the paper comes out, I'm going to buy a dozen and give them to everyone in the Fool's Gold Inn so they can see how I finally made good after all these years.

The lantern and the pie are the pefect start to a Pie Shrine! People will come by to look in shock and awe at its mystical crust... its steamy filling... it's unmistakable aroma...

Plus, I finished the Void Storm quests, got my armor, some shinies, an emerald that bathes me in green light and some furniture, and still have some points left :)

And all I was PLANNING on doing tonight was getting ready for the move to Najena. Oh well, maybe another day.
