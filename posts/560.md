# EQ2: Unrest Peek

I don't have time to join a group and fully explore Unrest right now. I'll admit what I saw looks spooky-scary and very reminiscent of the old EQ1 Unrest -- except this time, the yard trash is 72^^^, and there's plenty of it.

*From zone in. There are see-invis mobs two yards in front of me, hidden on the edges.*

Looking forward to dying a lot there :)
