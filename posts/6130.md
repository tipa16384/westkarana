After the couple of weeks at Master Gardener, I didn't expect to get to Grandmaster Gardener quite so soon. It was those Silver Trumpet Vines that did it; 300 xp per harvest, 3000 xp when they went elder, and I had four of the plants, the only remainders of my once-flourishing garden. I had a whole new plot picked out that has never seen a single seedling.

Now that leveling isn't a concern any more, I'll have to pick out plants for what they harvest. With all the pet snacks they've given, maybe I could finally level up one of my pets :)
