#Spore, the Widget#



I promise, after this, no more Spore posts.

The most fun in the game is creating creatures and space ships. Tonight I made a [Pierson's Puppeteer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierson%27s_Puppeteer) from Larry Niven's "Known Space" stories -- it's been done by others, but I like mine best. I made Corporal Legs and the spaceship Serial Peacemaker from Howard Tayler's "[Schlock Mercenary](http://www.schlockmercenary.com/)" web comic, and a couple others.

I was surprised nobody had done stuff from Schlock already.

Also watched Donnie Darko and the double episode of Buffy at the end of Season 2 where Angel gets his soul back and Buffy sends him to Hell anyway. So I'm in a weird mood.
