#Slashdot Moderator Again!#

It had been so many weeks since [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org) had chosen me to be a moderator. Was I not compulsively refreshing the page enough? Were they mad at me for becoming a [Digger](http://digg.com/)?

There were so many articles I was saying to myself - oh, if only I could moderate these.

And now I can. I feel obscurely happy.

Off to moderate!

Back! Miss me?

I moderated an article about [Search Engine Optimization](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/12/07/2119222&tid=95&tid=187)!

Now, the horrid waiting on the edge of my hard wooden chair for the next chance to moderate.

Oh yeah, new Slashdot meme - from the IM virus that chats with you on IM to get you to click on the link it sends - "lol this isn't a virus"... but will it supplant "1. do something 2. ???? 3. profit"? Who knows!?
