# Wizard 101: Plague Oni, why can't I quit you?

*Check out that xp bar! Less than one bubble to 46...*

I was tired and tuckered out last night from two late nights of programming image filters (the latest result is the candy-colored candy shop seen in my ShutterCal widget), but while a test image rendered, I thought maybe I'd just jump into Wizard 101 and see if Suri was up for a trip through Big Ben or Kensington. I love running through Big Ben.

She wasn't on, so I do what I normally do when I'm bored and running around Moo Shu. Head to Shirataki Temple and take on, once again, the Plague Oni. Takes about 45 minutes.

There are four mini-bosses and two major bosses in Shirataki, but the best loot is saved for the very last. The Plague Oni can drop a nice sword, a pet, and a wide variety of end game gear. But the past half dozen or so times I've killed it (as I creep toward level 46 from the xp gained killing the mobs along the way), I've gotten just one loot, and that one loot has always been trash. The Footwraps of Pictures that was the sole loot from Plague Oni? +21 health and +2% Storm resistance, Storm school only. I wouldn't wear that if I were a Storm wizard. It's trash loot.

Plague Oni used to drop good stuff -- I got my second sword here -- but now he drops nothing. My theory? The RMT NPCs that drop by to sell holiday gear also place some of that gear on NPCs. The Onis were said to drop some of it, sometimes. I think that screwed up their loot tables. Plague Oni supposedly drops my Life shoes. I've even GOTTEN THEM with my alt when I was two boxing, but of course there is no item trading in the game. But since Harvest Hannah arrived, it seems neither the Plage Oni nor the Jade Oni drop loot.

Anyway, after that disappointing run, I went to bed at 9PM and didn't wake up until 6AM.

This weekend I have to bring my son back to Warwick. I've been doing a lot of that. Last Sunday I drove him to RI. Wednesday I brought him back for a dentist appointment. Sunday I'll bring him back AGAIN. Two hours each way leaves me totally dead and exhausted.

I imagine this weekend I will re-install Lord of the Rings Online and check in on my Captain. I don't think I am going to restart on another server, but I might see what's happening on Winfola. I think my Captain was level 34 or so? There's been a lot of new stuff since I last played, and the North Downs grind might be a little more manageable.

Definitely going to get back into DOMO. I WANT TO PLAY SPELLBORN SO MUCH! I am trying my hardest not to get too involved in Spellborn because it all has to restart whenever Acclaim brings it to the States.

I hate having taken a taste and forced to wait for the meal.
