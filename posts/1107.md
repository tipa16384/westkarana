#EQ2: Failure Cascade#

I didn't want to talk about Winterwing before she finished the Butcherblock quest line, but while I was messing up an alliance between the Timorous Deep and Butcherblock aviaks, I looked up and caught the end of a partial eclipse of the sun as the un-blowed-up moon Drinal passed before it. Whichever artist did the sky -- well done. I was blown away.

Also, note that Winterwing has a gi now :) That's the Lonetusk Gi from a named in the Ruins. The stats are awful but... it looks like a gi, and now she doesn't have to do the woefully out-of-date armor quests in order to look like a monk again. Well, bruiser.

I should rather have chosen a toilet for a picture for this post. Last night, several more people left the guild, including its former raid leader and main tank, some healers, a couple other random people... and those who are left are getting a little worried. Maybe more than a little. Especially a friend I grouped with last night to do some Fens quests. He's got a physical handicap which he feels will hurt him should he apply to a new guild. It's nothing he can help, and Lord knows we all need some compassion for people with his condition.

You see, he's a paladin.

Yes, he is. And we love him anyway. But can he find a home elsewhere?

I may have to get in touch with Sally Struthers here. For just one raid a week, you can support a needy paladin and help him have a normal life.

The Escapist recently had an article called "[Riding the Failure Cascade](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_124/2645-Riding-the-Failure-Cascade)", and though they were talking about EvE orgs, they noted that this sort of catastrophe piled upon cataclysm happens everywhere. First one thing goes wrong. Then another. Then an important person leaves. Then some follow. Then its rats + sinking ship = taking my chances with the sharks.

That's where we are now. We've lost too many people to raid anything past Kingdom of Sky, the website is gone, our DKP history is gone. and the new guild leader is recruiting people in their 60s in the hopes they will grow and more importantly, STAY, one they've reached the cap.

I don't like leaving places. and it would be silly to think about going anywhere before I hit 80 with both Dina and Dera, to increase my options. Heck, maybe the guild leader can pull it off... but it looks for sure like we're caught in a Failure Cascade, and that only ends one place. The toilet.
