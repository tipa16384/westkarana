#The Evolution of Ebony#

A few weeks ago, the geek-o-sphere was abuzz with a picture of the Mona Lisa [drawn by fifty overlapping translucent polygons](http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/)... I thought it was a neat hack, and forgot all about it until last night.

I'd just gotten home from a painful root canal, and needed SOMETHING to take my mind off of it... So I decided to try my hand at this. I took his algorithm and implemented it in a REAL programming language -- Python -- not that filthy C#.NET -- using PyGame to do the rendering, and put a picture of my daughter's dog Ebony into the hopper, stepped back, and let evolution take its course...

Kind of abstract, isn't it? Here's the final image after I let it run a couple of hours:

Still needs some work, but I think it's pretty cool :) Needs heavy optimization to speed it up some, but it was a fun way to spend an evening and my tooth doesn't hurt any more :)
