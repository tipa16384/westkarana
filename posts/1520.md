# The Terrorists have left the building.

You know that Chinese restaurant fortune cookie game -- where you open up your fortune cookie, but have to read it aloud and whatever it is, say "in bed!" afterward? Like, "Tomorrow will be your lucky day -- IN BED!"

Hilarious!

So anyway, I have a little variation. Find a newspaper headline, and put it in the middle of "If ---, the terrorists win."

Let's try it with today's [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org) stories.

"If ICANN moves against GoDaddy domain lockdowns, the terrorists win."
"If astronomers locate solar system similar to our own... the terrorists win."
"If Richard Dawkins appears on Doctor Who... the Terrorists WIN."
"If Imperial Storm Troopers skirmish in IP battle... the Terrorist stormtroopers WIN."
"If Yahoo! rejects Microsoft's offer -- gawddammit, the TERRORISTS have ALREADY WON."

Remember, we fight them there so we don't have to fight them here.
