It was pointed out to me at some length in an elite STF tonight -- Infected -- that while these STF walkthroughs are fine for the normal mode task forces, elite task forces take slightly different strategies. Those strategies would work in normal mode, too, but nobody bothers with them. In normal mode STFs, these walkthroughs work fine.

Khitomer Accord is the most complicated of the space task forces. The Borg are attempting to go back in time via the time portal and arrange the past and present more to their liking. Probes are going to warp in on the two gateways and head (slowly) to the time portal. If ten get through, the mission fails. If even ONE gets through, the optional objective fails. Every one of the gateways, generators and transformers must be destroyed within 15 minutes, or the optional is failed.

Once all those are destroyed, an assimilated Reman Scimitar -- Donatra's Scimitar -- warps in. Once her ship is destroyed, the mission is won. The optional rewards and the mission rewards spawn above the time portal.

Let's take this step by step.

There's a tactical cube guarding the time portal at the start of the mission. Destroy that.

ONE SHIP needs to head over to the complex on the right. This is usually a tactical ship. This ship will destroy every probe and sphere that warps into that gateway. Those ships will head slowly toward the time portal once spawned. It is IMPORTANT that NO PROBE gets through. They don't have much health, they die fast. Spheres will spawn occasionally as guards; they must be destroyed as well, but probes always die first.

Some groups leave a ship in front of the time portal to take care of probes from both sides, but in my opinion, this lets probes get too close to the portal.

When the lone right side guard isn't killing stuff, it should be taking out the nanite generators around the transformers. It's important to always be shooting something in this STF (in all of them, actually).

Everyone else goes to the left side. Another tactical ship could be dedicated to taking down the probes, but it's no hardship for the team working on the generators and gateways to just take them out as they spawn. As long as someone does it.

The left and right complexes are copies of the complex from Infected, and die the same way. Kill the generators around one side, then the transformer, go to the other side and take down the matching generators and transformer, then the gateway.

Once the left gateway is killed, the RIGHT gateway will spawn a patrol of four probes and two spheres. Everyone should be headed there at full impulse to deal with the spawn, then take out the right complex as was done with the left. Spheres will continue to warp in to defend the complexes; it's important to keep those in check, but it's also important to get the gateways down before the optional timer expires.

Once everything is dead, Donatra's ship warps in near zone in. She does considerable damage and also occasionally spawns tractor probes to keep you in place. Every so often she will cloak and move away. When she decloaks, she will charge up her thalaron weapon and fire it, doing massive damage to everything in a cone in front of her. There will be lines showing her firing arc; move out of it if you're in it. Use evasive maneuvers if you need to. Best strategy is to keep generally behind the Scimitar as it is very weak from behind.

Once she's dead (and there's no timer at this point, take as long as you need), fly up above the time portal and grab your reward.

If you're new to Khitomer Accord, just stay with the main group and you'll do fine -- if you see some probes and you're in a position to shoot them, shoot them. If spheres are dogging you, pull them back to the group and get everyone shooting it. Don't be flying 20km out trying to solo it; the STF needs your weapons on the mission objectives.

Khitomer Accord (Space) is actually easier than Infected (Space). Being responsible for the right side while the rest of the group is doing the left side is a real lift. But if someone flies up and tries to help, let them -- head back to the main group.
