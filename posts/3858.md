Welcome to another daily blogroll!

EQ2 has [re-opened character server transfers](http://mmoquests.com/2009/07/15/character-transfer-potions-are-a-go/) via its Station Marketplace RMT store, halving the price and making the process as smooth as possible. I've started moving my essential characters from Najena and Befallen to Antonia Bayle, my original EQ2 server before my desire to play with friends led me to have characters on a half dozen servers. 

Lazaretto is going the other way, to the PvP server Nagafen, where life is a little different. For one, AAs are so important that people [pay high levels to lead them through high level zones for discovery experience](http://www.completeheal.com/?p=1387). 

Laz also writes about Vanguard's utter reversal of its claim to be the most hardcore MMO on the market to where it is now [catering to player desires for an easier, more casual-friendly experience](http://www.completeheal.com/?p=1371). Sounds good to me. Maybe they could do something about that terrible map while they're at it.

Angry Raider had an EQ2 epiphany of his own. Why worry about working to other people's goals, when the whole purpose of a game is to [log in, have some fun, and then go about your life](http://www.angryraider.com/archives/133)? Gordon of We Fly Spitfires [feels the same way](http://blog.weflyspitfires.com/2009/07/14/defining-goals/), and instead of working on other people's goals, getting Titan's Grip in WoW and a Megathron in EVE Online will do.

Hey, I'm working on a Megathron in EVE Online, too! It's a Nice Ship.

Ramon at Dalayan Diary [heads into a mysterious warpstone](http://dalayan.wordpress.com/2009/07/15/warpstone/) in the EQ-based Shards of Dalaya and finds it's kobolds all the way down. I'm usually pretty good at guessing which EQ zone corresponds to a given SoD zone, but this one eludes me. It looks too wide open to be any of the Sol dungeons. Maybe the Temple of Sol Ro?

Cuppy's [started a new blog](http://mmoblurbs.com/) for those who want to blog, but don't want the hassle of maintaining a site or promoting it. It's MMOBlurbs, you can post stuff just by sending an email, and though it's a little rough so far, it could be the perfect way to give a cookie to your inner blogger.

Beau Turkey wonders if end-game raiding really needs to be such a bore. What if you [replaced all the scripts and boredom with ... minigames](http://epicdolls.com/beauturkey/?p=1794), like in Puzzle Pirates battles? It could be fun :)

Dusty of Of Course I'll Play It settles the old argument about which a game should cater to more, the solo or the group player, by [proposing a "soloer flag"](http://ofcourseillplayit.com/?p=249). You couldn't do anything BUT solo, but you'd get special, solo-only versions of the game's dungeons, so even a soloer would have a chance to see everything. I suspect it would just turn every game into a ghost town.... most people group only because they have to to advance.

And lastly, MMOs may be like [women](http://blog.weflyspitfires.com/2009/07/12/mmorpgs-are-a-lot-like-women/), or they may be like [men](http://divagoth.com/2009/07/12/why-mmos-are-like-men-a-reply/), but Green Armadillo knows that [MMOs are really our furry little four legged friends](http://playervsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2009/07/why-mmorpgs-are-like-dogs.html). I've often thought MMOs were like biker movies of the '60s, but I can't explain why.

See you tomorrow, and keep on gaming!
