# Spellborn Gallery

I took a lot of pictures while adventuring in Spellborn. I intended to make a huge gallery post, but did a comic instead. You can see all the (decent) photos I took by visiting my [Spellborn Gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/brendahol/SpellbornGallery). Each screen shot has a caption explaining where it was taken and other interesting info. If you really want to get a feel for what the world of the Enclave looks like, [check it out](http://picasaweb.google.com/brendahol/SpellbornGallery).
