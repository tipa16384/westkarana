#Surya Fashions, Resort '06#

The Haven Girl brochure I did last week got printed up and we got them back yesterday (you can see the first page below). The printers finally used the Haven Girl logo font I specified instead of whichever one was their favorite that day. Came out pretty well. I tried to use more color. Have two more brochures arriving next week, probably while I'm on vacation. I'm seriously iffy about one of them.

The girl in the brochure is named Haven. When I first started working here, I didn't know if the line was named after her, or if she was named after the line...

I've had to go back and forth with the printers about three times for these Haven Bleu postcards. To ensure they actually used the fonts they were supposed to use, I embedded them in the picture. That just made things harder on me, since they could no longer change them at the line manager's request. So, next time I'll leave the text editable... lesson learned.

When they asked me to make this brochure for Basil & Maude, they plopped down this inkjet-printed piece of paper with a batik pattern on it, with thumbnails of the pictures they wanted taped to it. And they said, we want that same background bordering the pictures in the brochure. No, they didn't have the original, someone had emailed it to them. No, they didn't have that email.

So I untaped the pictures from it, scanned it, cleaned it up, cloned the pattern so it was large enough, and used it. It's a really strange pattern to begin with. Wish I'd had the original to it... Anyway, look for these clothes at Macy's, Nordstrom's, Stein Mart, etc.

Buy lots and lots of them. Vote for Haven Girl for the Dallas Fashion Awards!
