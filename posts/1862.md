#Twitter#

I signed up for Twitter a long time ago but forgot entirely about it until now. Anyway, my username there is tipadaknife (a play on Tipa the Knife from my rogue days, and Tip of the Knife. I can't remember who came up with that. It wasn't me, but I grabbed on to it :)

As I think of other social spaces I belong to and actually occasionally check, I'll add them to the Contact Me! widget on the sidebar so we can all meet up on our various places to be.
