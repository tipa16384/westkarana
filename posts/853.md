# Those lazy fire faeries...

So, my Neopet, Spitefur the Xweetok, was running around doing all his morning chores, when while at the Shrine of Colzac, a fire faerie appeared and demanded Spitefur find her scarf.

Come ON! She's a FIRE FAERIE! What the heck does she need a scarf for? Sheesh.

And even worse, the Shrine gave me nothing today.

I think it's burned out.

I blame the faerie.
