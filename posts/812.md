# EVE: I guess I shouldn't have named it after my cat...

It was a difficult mission -- stop a military transport, take everyone on it prisoner and bring them back to base for some fun -- and I think I did fairly well. Defeated the two scouts guarding the acceleration array (ie, zone line) to the instance, no problem, I was cooking with antimatter. Inside the deadspace instance, were a couple of ships... okay, I can take them on... and then many more... so much that I had to rabbit it back to base for some quick repairs. When I returned... two minutes until the transport arrived... I couldn't defeat all its guards by then. I decided to lead them a chase and circle back around.

The transport popped in from warp... with even more friends... so I bore down upon it with guns blazing. My shield boosters were redlining, my guns were over heating, and my hull looked like a hunk of Swiss cheese that had met a family of enthusiastic mice. I destroyed the transport... and then a dozen angry rebels finished off *Isis' Dark Laughter*.

I tried to take a shuttle back to retrieve the wreckage, but with so many rebels swarming about, there was nothing I could do.

I knew it was over when the insurance company paid off my claim. They even gave me a basic ship in which to scoot around. How nice.

I wasn't planning on keeping *Dark Laughter* forever, but I did hope she'd see me safely until I finished training to pilot Type III Gallenite Frigates, which I should achieve sometime early tomorrow morning. (Then it's back to the Science classes for me...)

I had a blueprint for a basic frigate hanging around, and last night I'd mined all the rare ores I will ever (ha!) need for basic shipbuilding, so I sent the job to a factory to build and logged into EQ2 to raid.

When I came back, *Isis' Silent Kiss* was ready for christening. A ship of that class is no match for the rebels, so I spent the evening killing some of the prowlers that lurk about various asteroid fields and doing odd jobs to get ISK.

Tomorrow, *Dark Laughter II* will hunt down those rebels. They will die quickly. Three 150mm Gatling Railguns with hybrid antimatter charges will see to that.

Above: *Isis' Silent Kiss*. I didn't have any pictures of my beloved *Dark Laughter* because I thought taking screenshots saved them to disk.

Number one question I asked when I saw EVE screenshots before I began playing was, is that what the game actually looks like? Yes, yes it does. Very cinematic pictures of spaceships and nebulas. And... that's pretty much it. EVE is not a very visual game. You can cover your screen with various windows and you won't miss much (I end up doing that quite a lot). They could make a client for ASCII terminals, probably. Even combat doesn't really require you to look -- when I fight, I'm watching the targeting scanners, keeping my weapons loaded, trying to keep the hull in one piece, keeping at correct weapon range and leaving a spare eye for the mission objectives.
