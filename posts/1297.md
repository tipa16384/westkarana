# Why this site was dead today


> The reason for this is because we needed to temporarily disable your website earlier today to prevent it from effectively "crashing" the webserver; your site was receiving a large number of hits to PHP scripts and was basically preventing other customers websites from loading. I have unsuspended the account now and the website should be back online -- I would recommend that you remove any unused PHP scripts and upgrade all other applications to the latest version, as we will be forced to delete the account if further high CPU usage by your account continues to affect other customers.




So anyway, my provider killed it without telling me. I guess a mention on Massively was too much for it.

Anyone recommend a good host that can deal with the occasional traffic spike?
