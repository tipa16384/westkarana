# Echo Boomer

I had no idea what an Echo Boomer was, when I saw they were being singled out for advertising. What is WITH all these demographics specifically set up to make you spend your money, anyway?

I suppose I slip in at the tail end of the Baby Boomer marketing generation, which supposedly ended in 1964. So, of us four kids, Val and I are boomers, and our sisters, born in 1969 and 1970, are some wild new generation we cannot understand (Generation X, I suppose).

But [Echo Boomers](http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-ech1.htm) are apparently, kids of boomers (our echoes!).

All hail the Echo Boom. A marketing demographic of people for whom the Internet and computers has always been part of their lives.
