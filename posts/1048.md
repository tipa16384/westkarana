# Still looking for a Mythos Beta invite?

Still looking for a Mythos Beta invite? Taylor Balbi, Community Manager for Mythos, [has given a bunch of new invites](http://westkarana.com/index.php/2007/10/25/mythos-beta/) to a couple of people and all you have to do is go to their IRC channel and ask!


> Hey guys! Well, you donâ€™t have to WAIT for an invite. You can head over to our IRC channel where we have given two of the long time fans a bunch of invites. The server: irc.forthegamers.org
The chan: #mythos
The Inviters: G-15 and Sulfuric!



Unfortunately, they didn't give any invites to *me*... but if you're looking to get in, check out that IRC channel.

*Edit: **READ THE COMMENTS** for an even better way to get a Mythos beta invite!
