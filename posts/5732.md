I've been trying to think of cool ways to punch up the look here at West Karana. Professional color schemes? Meh! An enlightened sense of design? BORING!

I had just the solution! What we really are all craving here in the 21st century are more BAR CODES! YES!

I read a LOT of science fiction when I was a kid. One thing that was mentioned again and again, more than [flying cars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gernsback_Continuum) and [weekend rocket trips to the Moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Number_of_the_Beast_(novel)), were bar codes. Gotta have them. On [the skin of our wrist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bar_Code_Tattoo), or on our home bots, or on the slips of paper [the company Compu-Tron](http://www.robotnut.com/ken/k53.htm) used to answer the deep questions, like, [what is the exact value of 'pi'](http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Wolf_in_the_Fold). Just before it [spitzensparken](http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/article09-100) and blew up. Blowing up was ANOTHER of [those cool future things that happened](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Repent,_Harlequin!%22_Said_the_Ticktockman).


Seriously, though, there's a time and a place for bar codes. And the place is NOT at the top of the article; it's at the bottom of the right sidebar --->

[QR Codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code) are two dimensional bar codes that can encode a fairly substantial amount of information. ([Master A. Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland) would consider QR Codes very intricate mazes). They are used here to encode the URL of the page you're reading. If you scan the code with a QR Code-enabled device, like the iPhone or a Droid with the appropriate software, you'll navigate instantly to the page, where you can perhaps save it to read later, bookmark it, write annoying comments in TXT SPK, or whatever.

QR Codes are finding their way into the wild. You see them on television and on billboards. It's like the [CueCat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CueCat), but without the little plastic kitty, or having to be seated at your computer.

There's a half dozen QR Code widgets for Wordpress-based blogs, like this one, and pages of QR Code software (much of it free) for iPhone and presumably Android devices. 

[qrcodetag size="500"]I wanted to write something short here, but it turns out even a couple paragraphs totally crashes my QR Code readers. So, take care, and thanks for reading![/qrcodetag]
