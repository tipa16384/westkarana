Yay! Another night where I successfully avoided writing! I KNOW what I want to do for the last part of the current Stout Henry adventure, I know how it begins, ends, the middle, but when I sit down to write, I do something else.

Tonight, I went back and played some more City of Heroes. it has changed a LOT just in the past few months. It has Rest XP now, and day jobs, and one mission that just threw DO enhancements at me. I upgraded near every power. With all the new recipes I got, there's going to be some evenings spent at the invention bench.

Oh yeah, I dinged 20. I didn't join any teams, though I got a lot of invites, because there was always the chance that I would suddenly start writing. Logged out at the Tailor. If I log out there for 21 days, I'll earn the Fashion Designer badge :)

I decided at 9:30 that no more excuses, I was going to write.

So i started off by changing the outfits on my Rock Band 2 avatar, and comparing the character creators between RB2, PS3 Home, Spellborn and Vanguard. Then I had to try out the new outfit on several sets. Then I changed the outfit some more and started trying for the Bass Groove achievement where you have to finish a song 100% on Expert using only upstrums. I did get the Gold Star achievement, but I don't know what that was for.

Then I worked through a few of the band challenges, then came back here intending to at least start writing, and did the joke post (below), and now it's 1 AM and since I have a dentist appointment tomorrow, have to go to work REALLY early to make up for leaving early.

I don't want to use Write or Die for this, but I don't think I have a choice.
