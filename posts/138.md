# A good day

My son is well again, I'm not sick anymore, my daughter is preggers. It's a warm San Diego Saturday afternoon. Cat's off his medicine. The apartment is clean, shopping is done. We went out and saw a good movie ("Thank You For Smoking"). Finished the two songs in Guitar Hero that was keeping me from the final set of five in the game on hard.

Few enough days are really good ones, but this is one of them.
