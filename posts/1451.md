#Could the next EQ2 expansion be... Guk?#

Massively [has been running a feature](http://www.massively.com/2008/03/14/part-two-of-eqii-lore-feature-escape-from-guk/) on newly-discovered EQ2 lore dealing with that famous EQ1 dungeon, Guk, the ancient home of the Frogloks.

Guk was just off the troll newbie grounds in EQ1, and was one of the two high level dungeons in the original EverQuest, the other being Nagafen's Lair, AKA Sol B. EQ2 lore tells us that the frogloks, ogres and trolls were driven from South Antonica during the Age of Turmoil and bombarded during the Shattering, leaving only The Feerrott behind. Guk, Innothule Swamp, Lake Rathetear, and the Rathe Mountains were erased. What remains of the Plains of Karana now are part of the Thundering Steppes.

It's clear Guk *could* still be out there, but the Feerrott separated Innothule Swamp from the Rathe Mountains, and *it's* still there. It's hard to see how, geographically, Guk and its swamp would be enough content on its own for an expansion, and you'd think someone would have discovered it prior to now if it had still been around.

The city of Guk was a vast, vast dungeon in two zones that could take players from their 30s to their 50s. It would be great to see it again in EQ2 in some form -- for the same level range. More midlevel content is a GOOD thing. The last was the revamping of Deathfist Citadel, and that went extremely well, very popular.
