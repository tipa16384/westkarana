#Where is SPELLBORN already?#

My constant trolling over on the [Chronicles of Spellborn](http://tcos.com) forums have as yet revealed no news about any North American release. They are supposed to be on the verge of open beta, and to have signed a letter of intent months ago with an unnamed US publisher (my guess, again: [Aeria Games](http://aeriagames.com)).

However, the Spellborn computer they collaborated with German PC makers Ultraforce on earlier this year, [they are now releasing case-only](http://tcos.com/sbforum/viewtopic.php?t=13769), in case you're not jazzed about the computer they had, but loved their case. 249 Euros, so US$384, probably closer to US$500 when all shipping and customs fees are paid, which is pretty expensive just for a case. Just not worth it to buy things from Europe when you live in the US any more.
