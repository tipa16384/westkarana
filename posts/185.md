He's smiling for the camera! Just 17 weeks old at the moment. There is some concern that he may have Down's Syndrome; Ally had to have amniocentesis today so they could get some amniotic fluid for testing. They had Matthew's conception date off a week, so it's likely just an error in the original test, which depends upon an accurate date of conception.

Anyway, we know now that he is a boy, he has five of the things that he should have five of, two of the things he should have two of, and so on -- he is looking very healthy.

Matthew Holloway-Purvis! What a name!
