#EQ2 Expansion Watch Contest#

Here's the contest (no prize except everlasting eternal fame... you know, if you're into that kind of thing).


 * Each day, go to the [US Patent and Trademark Office](http://uspto.gov) website.

 * From the menu on the left, click "Trademarks" and from the popup menu, choose "Search TM database (TESS)"

 * Select "Freeform Search"

 * Enter **"Sony Online Entertainment"[ON] AND "Everquest II"[WM]** into the search field and Submit Query.

 * Look for an expansion aside from RoK, KoS and EoF. Desert of Flames apparently was not trademarked.

 * Post it everywhere -- you have just discovered the new EQ2 expansion!




This works for other games, too!

*Due to the oddities of the USPTO website, you might miss some matches, so it's best to just look for SOE without the game name and pore through the lists. Note that some unfamiliar titles like "EVERQUEST EVOLUTION" or "EVERQUEST ATTACK ON QEYNOS" may be for omnibus collections or undeveloped expansions. "EVERQUEST WAR ON FAYDWER" may have been a proposed name for the "Secrets of Faydwer" EQ1 expansion.*

*Also, there's a chance that future trademarks could be registered by SCEI, especially if they wanted to be sneaky about it. That's why it's a **contest**! Try **"Sony Computer Entertainment"[ON] AND "Everquest"[WM]** to try and catch them at that game.*
