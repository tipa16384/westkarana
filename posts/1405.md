#Blogroll#

I deleted a couple of inactive or entirely dead sites from my blog roll, and added several blogs I have in my feed but didn't have here. If I forgot yours, let me know :P

Typically I don't link to gamer blogs that don't have blog rolls, because I feel that puts a dead end in the little community we form by linking our blogs together. I usually wish people would link back for the same reason :) But it's okay if you don't want to for some reason.

Some people are wary of "link sharing" schemes, where people try to up their position in search engine results by getting a lot of trash blogs to link to their trash blog. Well, I don't make a cent from this blog and don't care where I fall in Google results, so no worries there :)
