If SOE sticks to the schedule, then The Shadow Odyssey should be live about now.

Amazon tells me my box was shipped today and should be here in time for Thanksgiving. I didn't remember to also buy a digital download for my main account, so guess what I'll be doing when I get home...

Tonight and for the rest of this week, it's going to be all about The Shadow Odyssey. I want to go on a crafting mission, first thing. My tailoring is at 60, which should be good enough -- and I have an 80 jeweler if needed. In fact, I can two box them.

As for the real meat of the expansion, the dungeon crawls. I have to admit that I haven't fallen in love with the latest dungeons, Runnyeye: the Gathering and Veksar. No group I've been in has even finished Veksar. Though I was in the EQ2 beta, I ran out of disk space to keep both the live game and the beta one patched and ready to play, so after looking around just a very little, went back to the live game. So it's all still new to me.

The parts that I have seen, though, look absolutely fantastic, and I am very much looking forward to seeing these places. The best part about EQ's LDoNs (and later, DoNs) were that they were good xp and other rewards, and they didn't require you to sign up for four hours in order to get anything done. Group up, get in, spend half an hour to an hour in the dungeon, and then you're done and can do another or go your own way.

SOE has a pretty good track record of doing just this for instances past Desert of Flames (Poet's Palace in DoF was just never going to be quick), so I am looking forward to bite-sized chunks of adventure goodness and hopefully some serious Nostalgia for places last seen hundreds of years ago, in EverQuest.

See you in Norrath!
