# Star Trek Online: What would you say to Cryptic?

![](http://westkarana.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/GameClient-2010-02-24-06-55-51-65.jpg "Surveys sent right to the ship!")

This morning I, and likely every other Star Trek Online subscriber, received a survey from Cryptic asking how we liked the game so far, if we were likely to subscribe past the first month, what other games we played, what our favorite parts of the game were (Character/Ship customization), what parts we thought were really ill-thought and crappy (Memory Alpha) and so on.

There were no long form questions where we could explain to Cryptic just what I really want from their game. So here's what I'd say to them -- and based on my comments, I think a lot of Star Trek players are thinking the same things.

Cryptic, you've made a really fun and enjoyable game, but you shipped with only two or three month's worth of content. Once you reach max level, there is no reason to ever play that character again, and it's unclear how "raidisodes" will change this much, unless you take the WoW route and make raid progression its own sort of leveling game. But that would kill the casual nature of the game so far.

So here's what I'm thinking, and some of these are things you have either announced or hinted at.

**Ships**

At the Battle of Wolf 359, remembered in one of the very first systems you see after leaving Sol, Starfleet didn't just send admirals commanding large, lumbering ships. They sent every ship they could find. There should be a use and purpose for every ship you can command, from the DS9 runabouts to the Miranda-class light cruiser you start with to the battlefield dominating Sovereign-class star cruisers. The runabout could perhaps move directly from one starbase to another. The Defiant-class escorts could move too fast to be targeted by battleship and dreadnought weapons -- things like that.

Make ship upgrades an option, but not something you are compelled to do when you are promoted. Captain Janeway commanded the Voyager all the way back from the Delta Quadrant. Tell me that an admiral would be ashamed to command it.

Don't admirals have more than one ship under their command, anyway?

**Territory**

We're shown all the time just how bitter the war is. Federation vs Klingon vs Romulan vs Reman vs Cardassian vs Undine vs Hirogen vs Jem'Hadar vs Borg. We're in a war with many fronts, but no battle is ever won or lost. Make things matter.

The Klingons can have the Qo'noS sector, Feds can have the Sirius sector, everyplace else is contested. Even if all you do is warn players they are entering space controlled by the Klingons, and color the map red and nothing else, at least there'd be a reason to do the PvP scenarios or fleet actions in those places. Maybe the Borg are encroaching on Klingon space. Does the Federation join with their enemies for the common purpose of driving away the Borg, or do they stall for a bit in order to gain some advantage over their foes?

The state of the war should be up to the players. This keeps players invested in the game and makes memorable battles -- the outcome of which can change the state of the game. As it stands, nothing you do has any consequence. Make it matter.

**"Crafting"**

Memory Alpha is a poor joke. Turning in stuff you happen to find laying around to upgrade useless things in enough quantities so that you can do it all over again with another NPC until, eventually, somewhere down the line, you finally get to something you might use?

The whole thing is pointless. I don't know anyone who does more than the very first turn-in upgrades.

Players need to be able to build consoles, weapons, kits, equipment, even ships. Tom Paris built the Delta Flyer. Why can't we? Every engineer in Starfleet has their own secret way of modifying the deflector dish to do something special. Why can't we?

Feds can breed tribbles. Klingons should be able to breed targs! Cooks should be able to make truly incredible meals that will grant their crews some bonuses. Memory Alpha needs to become a research center for players, a whole planet just for crafting. That would be nice.

**Seasons**

You call your story missions "episodes". I love the story missions! My favorite part of the game. Why not expand that a little, and every couple of months, come out with a "season finale" or something that will take into account what the players have done since the end of the last "season" and advances the plot. If the Federation has been vigilant in keeping the Borg at bay, have them up their attacks on the Klingons. If the Klingons have been ignoring Romulan arenas, have Romulans step up their attacks in Klingon space. Etc.

**Other races**

First, give the Klingons their own PvE arc. The Klingon House vs House PvP arenas means nothing when you don't even know which House you're in, or which you are fighting. Flesh that out. Give Klingons a heritage and have their PvE storylines revolve around honor and House politics.

I want to play the Romulan storyline. Their struggle to keep their race and empire alive after their home world was destroyed is epic. Let us see that first hand.

The Cardassians have been decimated by the Dominion. It's incredible that they still have such hatred for the Federation -- they should be gathering strength and allies to at the very least shut the wormhole down.

Why not have Vorta and Jem'Hadar storylines? If I remember correctly, at the end of Deep Space 9, the Founders were dead because of Section 31's evil plots. Their subject races clearly are trying to keep the Dominion together. Let's get into their skins and live those stories.

**Other Factions**

Starfleet is a great organization and all, but once you're admiral, where do you go from there? You resign your commission and join the Maquis, or Section 31, or you make contact with the Time Patrol and help keep the timeline clear. Or maybe you just take an exploration ship and specialize in exploration and first contacts. Other paths of advancement. Becoming an admiral in Starfleet (or a brigadier general in the Klingon Empire) should only be the START of your career.

**I REALLY LIKE STAR TREK ONLINE!**

I end this by pointing out that I really like STO! I love the bridge officer advancement; I have really grown attached to my crew. The story missions are great, and certain of the fleet battles are pretty amazing. But right now, all I can tell people who ask about STO is that it is a great game for a month or two. For STO to thrive, I should be able to tell people what they'll be working on a year after they subscribe, what kind of advancement will be open to them in four years. I can't do that right now.

STO had a good start, but content needs to be coming fast and furious, much faster than was done for Champions Online. You have one of the two best SF licenses in the world. Don't let it go to waste.
