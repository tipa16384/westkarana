#Wizard 101: Is Crafting the key to the new boss battles?#

A lot of commentators in yesterday's blogroll felt the changes to boss battles in Wizard 101 are bringing the game away from its casual, kid-friendly roots. It's important to remember that even easy games like World of Warcraft would seem difficult if the solution to every single quest, instance and boss mob weren't carefully explained to people.

Soon every single quest, instance and boss mob fight will be figured out and carefully explained to every W101 player, and these will be easy again. Thomas of [The Friendly Necromancer](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/) noticed that there is now a huge forge outside the Grand Chasm (Malistaire's lair, forge pictured above), and harvestable items throughout the instance. It's not too much of a stretch to assume that the new Malistaire fight consists of crafting certain treasure cards which would nullify or reflect his constant progressive AEing.

There's also yet another Myth gear recipe vendor in Dragonspyre Academy. I have not yet seen recipe vendors for the other schools...

But I did check out crafting. I have not yet found any treasure card crafting recipes, but the higher level gear recipes require treasure cards as one of their reagents.

AND -- crafting crafts LOTS of unique house items. What we have here, fellow wizards, is a full on assault by crafting. Not only will crafting likely be required for high level boss battles, but your home will not look very special unless you are friends with a skill user of the crafting table.

And some of these recipes have a 27 HOUR cool down, too.
