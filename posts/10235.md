Team Spode continued through Act II in Diablo III last night, edging our way closer to the chapter's fight against Belial. So far, though, the boss fights haven't been that much of a problem, as we're excessively paranoid about \_those\_. The \_problem\_ is just the good, old-fashioned mobs.

Mobs here in the literal sense, as they do tend to swarm, and I came close to dying a couple of times. I do have a couple get out of jail free cards as a Monk; the group heal of course, weapons that heal me when I hit, a special move that goes around hitting lots of stuff making me invulnerable while it is active, and potions.

I've also been using the hardcore auction house to fill in weak spots because I really, really don't want to start over.

None of those things were saving us as we ran into a desert ambush. My health was down to a sliver by the time I was able to run free and grab a potion, yelling into the mic that I was fleeing.

Calrain wasn't so lucky. Monks are a little squishy, but wizards absolutely can't deal with mobs of mobs, and his character died, poofed, and left the group. Second death for him.

He had a level 5 hardcore demon hunter in his back pocket, though. We figured out the tap dance necessary to boost his character up to our current quest in Act II. That lost us all a bit of progress, but that's fine. We headed back into the fray for a couple of dungeons and Calrain leveled from five to seven. He'll be back up to level soon; D3 is great about that.

What concerns me is that the ambush that nearly wiped us this time, is, because we've jumped backward slightly, in our future again.

Time to really, really stick together....

Aside from Calrain, the group ended the night at level 21. It's only Spode and me that have not yet restarted, and I have this feeling that when we meet Diablo himself, I'll have restarted.

I should start another hardcore monk... just in case.
