#WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE???#

At times, we at Surya email our customers to alert them to upcoming warehouse sales. People ask to be added to the list at warehouse sales, so it isn't spam.

I guess a customer decided to repay us the favor, and passed along [this chain letter](http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/nothing/microsoft-aol.asp).

It must be true, because George W. Bush, the PRESIDENT of the USA, mentioned it in the SAME SPEECH he nominated SAMUEL ALITIO to the Supreme Court!
