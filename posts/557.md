#EQ2: Mad Bard#

Live Update 32 went in this morning, bringing Unrest, Brell Day, and new achievements. I was so excited when I saw that bards had gotten a new Selo's run speed buff - Selo's Speed of Sound.

Maybe bards would once again be the fastest runners around, but it wasn't to be. It was just a rescaling of the Selo's line so that top buff would come at 55 instead of 41 (or whatever it was). Our top speed without J-Boots is still 46%. Very disappointed.

The top talents on everyone's Kingdom of Sky Achievement trees were lowered in cost from eight to two points, giving players the chance for the first time to get to the end in two branches of the tree. I chose the Harbinger (wisdom) line once more for Don't Kill the Messenger, and moved from the Bladedance (strength) line to the Minstrel (intelligence) line both to boost my spell damage, and to get the Minstrel title. That was another change for LU 32 -- you earn titles based on the KoS AA lines you complete.

If they extended that to the EoF AA lines, I'd also be able to choose Resonator as my title... so maybe it's good they didn't...
