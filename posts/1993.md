# EQ2: Najena preview

SOE has [a great preview](http://eq2players.station.sony.com/news_archive_content.vm?id=1898Â§ion=News&locale=en_US) of their re-imagining of the dungeon of Najena on their web site.

I loved the original Najena -- it was the first raid I ever did with the guild I'd just joined, United Norrath Coalition, and I must have been all of level 19, and Drelzna hated druids so much, she harm touched me to death every time she popped.

Good times. I don't expect it to be the sort of casual fun Najena was in EQ1 (which, despite what people say, was pretty much the ultimate casual, social MMO), but it will be nice to see what it has become.

Ironforge, looks like...

But without the dancing naked night elves.

I don't think Najena dances.
