#EQ2: Rise of Kunark rumors#

THIS TURNED OUT TO BE A JOKE.

Sorry for falling for it. It really did sound to good to be true.

Take this with a generous helping of salt. Someone was claiming they had found a feature list for EQ2: Rise of Kunark, and it included these things:

 * Beast lords

 * New look for Iksar (closer to EQ1 models)

 * New gnomish mounts

 * Levitate for mages

 * Mounts that can attack



Sounds more like a wish list than a feature list, and I suppose we'll see what the truth is in a few more months.
