# DOMO's Nude Switch

Norikue pointed out the possible reason why everyone but me seemed to be stripped to their skivvies. The mysterious check box marked "Show Equipment" in the Options window, which I (of course) had checked.

Here's what part of the crowd near the Eversun teleport point looks like with that switch checked:

CLEAR that switch, and suddenly, everyone's wonderful clothing suddenly appears! And it also answers another question of mine -- which was, how come everyone but me fights exclusively hand-to-hand?

I'm thinking something got mistranslated somewhere along the way...

While I was in game anyway, I got my pet resurrected. 680 gold -- OUCH. And now it's mad at me, so I have to play with it for fifteen minutes or so...

Text on the player stalls got squoze oddly. It's actually readable in game. I must have some odd switch unchecked in Photoshop as well...
