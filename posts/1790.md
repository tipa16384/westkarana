# To my music-starved guild.

I can't believe you guys had NEVER heard of the bands I listen to. I mean, I'm hardly on the cutting edge, and these bands aren't that obscure...

Okay, backstory here for those who weren't on Vent last night during our Veksar run. Rogbog was web-casting our Nostalgia night to the world (interest when it was us killing dragons: high. Interest when it was us grinding levels and AA: low). Anyway, he was running some music behind the video, I asked him who it was, he said [Cake](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbzt1HnVzIQ), I thought they reminded me of [King Missile](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byDiILrNbM4) and I happened to mention some of the bands I listened to, and nobody had heard of any of them... Now usually people make fun of my musical tastes because I like 70s bands like Jethro Tull and Blue Oyster Cult, but THESE bands aren't old... so I was surprised.

Anyway, these bands are on heavy rotation on my Eee.
