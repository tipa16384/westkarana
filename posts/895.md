#Im in ur mind, twisting ur thoughtz#

Remember that old meme, that started "Im in ur base, killing ur dudez" back in Starcraft? Well, Wired has revived it for their Geekapedia, and they let you put in your own variations and vote on those submitted by others. It's fun :) But then, I like lolcats...

Anyway, the title is my entry, and [here's the link](http://www.wired.com/culture/geekipedia/magazine/geekipedia/im_in_ur) so you can add your own!

But please... keep my mom out of it?
