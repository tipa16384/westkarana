#Spellborn soundscape#

Saw this on [WarCry](http://www.warcry.com/news/view/87141-Chronicles-of-Spellborn-Hawksmouth-Soundscapes); it's a video of the shard of Hawksmouth in Spellborn with the ambient sound and music going. It's... strangely relaxing. The streets they show are streets I'd like to walk down. The whole thing reminds me a lot of Baldur's Gate II, but with modern, 3D graphics...
