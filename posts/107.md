#Kingdom of Loathing#

For those of you who love the hyper-realism of [Order of the Stick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Order_of_the_Stick) and have maxed out your [ProgressQuest](http://www.progressquest.com/) characters, give [Kingdom of Loathing](http://www.kingdomofloathing.com/) a try. Web based, single player, usually hilarious.

Tipa is a level 1 Turtle Handler. I think she has enough Musclarity or whatever to level...
