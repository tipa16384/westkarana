# Temple of the Roguelike: How did I miss THIS?

Back in the early 80s, I was too totally proud of my [roguelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike), real-time dungeon crawl game imaginatively named TG (The Game, clever, huh?), which had some all-time design wins like being real time, fast-paced, and required you to type all your actions out in *Zork*-like sentences. When a dragon is tracking you down, typing "TAKE SWORD FROM STONE" without any spelling errors probably isn't as fun as I thought it was back then.

Anyway, apparently (news to me!) [Temple of the Roguelike](http://www.roguetemple.com/) has [just run a contest](http://www.roguetemple.com/2008/03/08/the-7drl-challenge-2008-has-started/) all about making ASCII-based, dungeon-crawl games in the vein of [*Rogue*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28computer_game%29) and *[Nethack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nethack)* in just *seven days*!

I'd totally have given this a shot. I haven't written a roguelike in awhile; back in the 80s, though, you couldn't walk two feet without tripping over a dozen. My favorite was *[Larn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larn)*, largely because, unlike *Nethack*, it was usually possible to win. Even though I contributed to *Nethack*, I never won it legitimately.
