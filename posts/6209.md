CCP has been sending me "come back to EVE" e-mails for awhile now, touting variously their refund of learning skills, the new character creator, soon the "captain's quarters" where capsuleers can get out of the pod and stretch their legs.

So, what the heck, I took them up on their latest offer. I made a character portrait that looks vaguely like me, except my skin is worse and I look way older.

Anyway, my nullsec fleet had kicked me out, and I was back in highsec somehow, only about six jumps from my home base in Aunia. I'm going to have to figure out how to contract back the Domi they lent me, and I'm going to have to do it pretty fast. I just don't think I can ever go back to EVE.

Inertia is the inclination of moving objects to keep moving, and for stationary objects to stay put. Once you get going in EVE, it's easy to keep going. The skill queue charts your course, you have your market ops and your research and the ongoing political situation with your allies and enemies, and it's just easy to keep moving in that space.

But should you stop -- your skill queue empties out and you forget what you were training to do, nobody in game remembers you anymore, your research seems pointless and you are no longer connected to the game. News of a griefer olympics makes space seem even colder.

It's inertia, and it would take a powerful shove to keep things moving again.

I'm in a weird spot with MMOs at the moment. Since I didn't want to play in any of the recent Rift betas, I've been floating between games. Lucent Heart, DDO, even EverQuest II.

My adventures in Fortune League, the EQ2-themed fantasy adventurer trader game on Facebook, have led directly to sparking my interest in its parent game once again. As much as I love my troubadour, her time has passed. But my berserker ...

First of all, she looks really cute. The latest gear and skill changes have made it far easier to gear her up. I had some issues with her AA, but redeeming a Fortune League AA scroll made me five AA points last night. I also redeemed one of the XP potions I won and ground minotaurs in Steamfont for writs until I made two levels (in one hour) and dinged 52, where I can get the Mastercrafted stuff.

I'm not sure anyone particularly needs a midlevel faerie fighter, but who needs groups, anyway?

While EvE is still stuck in one place, Fortune League has given EQ2 a little bit of a push and set it in motion.

Which is, as I mentioned, too bad, since Rift starts Thursday.
