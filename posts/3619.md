*Jamming and dancing after the show. Note the concert tees, put on only AFTER the show, as according to the Rules of Live Concerts*

I admit it. I had fun at The Dares concert inside Free Realms last night. The Dares, who wrote and sing the Free Realms theme song "It's Your World", were live on stage in E3 and live on stage across all servers in Free Realms.

Though I'm not sure how live they actually were; Stargrace told me that they'd played a longer set live, and in game they sounded exactly like the song we've all heard. The band would suddenly appear on stage several times singing snippets of the same song, so what I think we ACTUALLY got was The Dares live on stage at E3, and a pre-recorded performance in game.

Zam's Free Realms pro-site writes that The Dares won [a Guinness Book of World Records certificate](http://fr.zam.com/story.html?story=18275) for the first simultaneous live and real world concert. Hard to believe that this hasn't been done in someplace like Second Life before, but, grats Dares :)

The pre-concert waiting reminded me a lot of real open-air concerts. People were making noise and running around, pets were everywhere, roadies were up on the stage trying to get people excited, the band was late.... A good time to meet up with friends. Stargrace was there, and Jason from Channel Massive showed up, Beau Turkey was lurking about, Caffo and Cambrian were in the house, it was SO COOL to be hanging out with friends waiting for the concert to begin, even if the experience was virtual.

Suddenly, the Dares were on stage, they played their song and then were going. That was it? That was it. I caught most of it using Free Realms' in-game video recorder, but the file it made was SO LARGE, I had to run it through Windows Movie Maker and re-encode it before I could upload it to YouTube.

Afterward we hung out for awhile, danced, showed off our outfits, put on our concert tees and chatted.

I... I really had FUN.
