# American Idol Top 3 night

1) David Cook. Randy needs to shut up. David C brings down the house.
2) Syesha. I love her. She's totally got a career.
3) David Archuletta. He ruins whatever he touches.

David C. and Syesha for final 2 -- my dream matchup.

Gawd, they're doing the recap right now and every time Archie sings it's sleep-inducing (though his second song was good). I love, er, hate how he ruined the Dan Fogelberg song.

DialIdol is predicting David C by a landslide, David A next, and Syesha to come third. That's a CRIME against HUMANITY. No WAY Archie deserves to make it into the final two.
