# Firefox saves the day

![](http://sfx-images.mozilla.org/affiliates/Buttons/180x60/safer.gif) The Warehouse manager tried to print out a tracking sheet, but IE bluescreened on him. I'd seen this on another computer... It worked fine in IE on *my* computer, and in Firefox, which got me thinking...

I installed Firefox on his computer, and it worked fine. Now, I don't know why IE crashes, and Firefox does not. The printer driver is the same, the FedEx site is (presumably) the same, the computer is the same...

Well. When the revolution comes and I install Linux on everyone's computer, that's one less IE against the wall.
