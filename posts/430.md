#Green Monster Games and Other Ramblings#

![Schilling_NPC_in_EQ2_closeup.jpg](http://westkarana.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/Schilling_NPC_in_EQ2_closeup.thumbnail.jpg)On the news that [Green Monster Games](http://www.greenmonstergames.net/) is continuing to drain people from SOE, I have to wonder just what happened to Curt Schillings' avatar within EQ2. It was supposed to be put in game somewhere after the ALS promotion ended... My guess? In a dark, secret room somewhere that players never see, Curt Schilling's avatar is killed over and over by a horde of giggling goblins while the manacled avatars of Blackguard and Moorgard watch helplessly.



I do wish GMG all the best. I know whatever game they come up with, I'll love, since I love EQ2, and heck, it's going to be the same team.

I look forward to making my dark elf ranger, Drriizzzzt Dou'urten. When I guided in EQ1, I'd get a petition from a Drizzt. And then a Driiztt. And then a Tzzird. I'd get confused -- had I talked to these people before? Or was it someone new with a similar name? I'd flag them to have a GM consider changing their names for them at some point. We weren't supposed to mention their names to them when they petitioned... [I forgot that at the worst time ever once...](http://westkarana.com/?p=342) it was supposed to be an issue only when a player ratted them out... Now with the new web-based petition system, petitioning is such a gigantic pain in the rear that I doubt many bother with it anymore. At the Fanguard last year, it was revealed that every single character name will need to be approved by a GM before that character can be completed.

Where was I? Oh yes... will anyone be able to complain about names based on R. A. Salvatore's work when it's his game to begin with? It's like a *homage*, isn't it?

I'd like to see this in the GMG MMO: a GM comes down in the shape and form of Drizzt Do'urden. Twin falchions ablaze. Who dares take my name? He'll shout. You are no member of my House. Begone! BOOM!

Heck, I'd make a Drrrizzzzzzttttt just to see that!

I'll admit to a tiny bit of depression concerning my adventures in the blogosphere lately.

I left a comment over at [Mystic Worlds](http://notadiary.typepad.com/mysticworlds/2006/12/missing_the_god.html) in her entry where she never feels as if she can wade through low level mobs killing each one with one mighty swing of her Volkswagen-sized glowing sword, and about the lack of pictures of awe-inspiring, mighty dragons and other creatures of similar stature. Anyway, I linked to a bunch of pictures of glowy weapons and big boss mobs but... the comment was marked as spam.

Sigh.

Despondent, I turned to EQ2-Daily for other blogs that could use the haffer touch. I found a pointer to a nice post in [Chronicles of Me](http://brettevents.blogspot.com/2006/12/diversions.html) about some guy's adventures soloing with a new paladin in EverQuest 1. Not sure why an EQ1 article showed up on EQ2-Daily when should I post a non-EQ2 article, EQ2-Daily panics and won't index my blog until they're sure I won't make that same mistake once more.

Anyway, I read through the article, which was all about how back in the day, he had to make that thirty minute run followed by a twenty minute boat ride from Qeynos to Kerra Isle (a boat went straight from Qeynos to Erudin, and a couple minute run/swim would bring you right to the isle, so actually it was a fairly quick journey considering), and how he had to battle legions of gnolls to get through Blackburrow so he could run to Halas and get spirit of the wolf from a Barbarian shaman (my memories of early EQ1 include shamans and druids selling SoW pretty much everywhere, or often free for the asking).

Anyway, his post was about the newbie experience in EQ1 today, and I suggested that instead of trying to solo hideously tough creatures, to go to Paludal Caverns where there would be groups and also solo mobs as well as many drops which sell for good money... and my post was summarily deleted. Follow that link above.

Crushed. Crushed, I am.
