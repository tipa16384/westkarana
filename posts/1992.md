#Not press, don't wanna be.#

Jaye [wrote this weekend](http://www.journeyswithjaye.com/?p=1365) about the notion that bloggers might be press, and she goes on to define press as the process of getting information out to the public. Presumably without bias or commentary.

If that's what the press is these days, they're doing a really poor job of it. Turn on the TV and watch coverage of the presidential election, and see if you can tell who is for which candidate. One thing you can say for bloggers, agree or disagree with us, at least you know where we stand. Our biases our right out in the open.

When you know the biases of the writer, you can decide whether it colors their news, or blog updates. Real journalists hide their biases. They have them -- everyone does -- but you don't know what they are, and that's much less honest.

Should bloggers be given press credentials if we aren't really press? My gut feeling says no. Once bloggers start thinking that they are anything more than a regular player with a website, they may suddenly feel they are speaking for the community when they write, that their opinions should be given more weight.

That's totally not the case. Bloggers speak only for themselves, and all any of us are, are players with a website. We are not press.

And I can't really see anyone PAYING me to write snarky things about their game, anyway :)
