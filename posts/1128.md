#What a wonderful post! Ah, it was a great Tuesday !#

I just get a kick out of my comment spammers. I just loves them to death, always right there for me, telling me what a great writer I am, abstracting my posts and linking back to me... your kids might not like you, your spouse might not like you, your dog might not like you, but somewhere, there's a spammer who thinks you're great!
