#The Middleblog#

Just discovered [the blog of Javier Grillo-Marxuach](http://themiddleblog.livejournal.com/), the creator, writer and artist for "The Middleman" comics and the new TV series of the same name. Monday nights. ABC Family. Lots of inside info about upcoming episodes and behind the scenes stuff. Yeah, I know YOU'RE already watching the best comedy SF show on television right now, but I'm just letting those other people who are too good and hip to watch television know about it.

I mean, I just can't believe where you (not you, those other people) get off always telling me TV is crap. Every single season I have to come back and say, look at this, this, and this. Now my preggers (but not for long) sister has just revealed she has just started getting into Battlestar Galactica. Welcome to three years ago, Hillary :) Finally, though!

So anyway. The Middleman. You'll love it. You overseas people, it's just now starting to hit the torrents.
