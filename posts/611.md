# 27 Degrees

That's how cold it was in Hartford, Connecticut yesterday morning. That's how cold it was when I spent four hours in and waiting for buses because my car had finally made it to Connecticut from California and I had to return my rental then go home. Slowly.

Coincidentally, that very night I flew back to California to finish up things here and to pick up our new cat. (It was 59 degrees in Los Angeles when I landed at 9:30 PM. By the way.)

My cat, Nostromo, is getting old and he has a skin condition that I'm very allergic too. My daughter suggested she take him, and I take one of her cats... so... tomorrow Isis returns to the frigid East with us, and Nostromo gets to stay in California.

Pretty clever cat!

I'm sure I'll enjoy Connecticut more when spring finally arrives. But here in Escondido, it's warm, I'm wearing a tank top, and the hills are lushly green (oh, but they'll turn brown soon).

My son just called me because suddenly all the wireless connections in the apartment complex went dead all at once. My two years of solving random mysterious computer problems for a living told me just what to ask:

 2. Turn it off and on.

 4. Is the wireless button on?



Oh yeah, that was it. I didn't even get to "Is it plugged in?".
