# The Episode of the Beast

Yesterday was June 6th, 2006 - 6/6/6 - and naturally, the entertainment industry was full of devil love for the day. The entire pointless remake of [the Omen](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060605/REVIEWS/60524002/1023) came out; [Slayer kicked off their Unholy tour](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/musicnightlife/2003041078_slayer05.html); and Doctor Who woke Satan.

The Doctor and Rose found themselves stranded on a planet suspended above Hell. The TARDIS is lost, you see - and doesn't it seem like the TARDIS is about as reliable as the original Star Trek transporters? Anyway, they are stuck with a group of good, ordinary, working-class Brits (in Doctor Who, working class accent = not evil) on a planet hovering over Hell. Yup, just them. And their demonic slaves, the Oud. Who start chanting that the beast has awoken, all will serve him. There are deaths; one woman is sucked straight into Hell.

I am sure the Doctor will point out next episode that he defeated Satan way back when he was Tom Baker...

*"No! I'll talk! Just don't shine that green light in my face again!"*


Screen grabs from the "The Impossible Planet" and "Pyramids of Mars, Part 4". Look how much nicer the high definition NEW Doctor Who is than the muddy broadcast version from the 70s.
