# City of Heroes Architect: Killer Klowns

Last night was one of those kinds of nights where you're trying to pass a kidney stone, drinking gallons and gallons of water, and you know, it would be a really nice time to KILL. SOMETHING.

Trying some of those City of Heroes Architect player-created mission arcs on the test server sounded just about right, so Kasul and I headed there to see what trouble we could cause.

My level 21 ninja/ice mastermind had finally been copied, so we weren't going to have to do missions at level 1. Kanad made a new character, and I chose him as my lackey so we could both take somewhat higher level missions.

The first one, where we have to disrupt some dangerous archaeology, was filled with closely-packed groups of extremely dangerous mobs, and was just one death after another. After half a dozen wipes, we decided to abandon that one.

Kanad chose a kinder, gentler mission full of clowns. Everyone likes clowns, right? Especially clowns that represent fast food restaurants, and whose minions are named after food. Flame broiled, frosty, etc.

That was a lot of fun :) Still, the enemies in player missions seem quite a bit more dangerous than the normal mission, with a far wider variety of powers, even in the lower level runs.

We made a fair amount of xp and infamy, some invention stuff, and architect tickets we could turn in for more architect mission creation stuff, as well as enhancements and other stuff.

(Kanad has done a [much better writeup](http://shatteredblog.wordpress.com/2009/03/24/architecture/) of this over at his blog!)
