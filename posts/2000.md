# Hi, latest new blog scraper

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-09-23 16:53:32*

Just a shout out to my newest reader, whom I won't name. It's another blog scraper taking my entries, which I write for my own fun and the fun of others, and trying to make money from them! And not giving me any of it! It just isn't fair!

And it sounds like my newest scraper could afford to send me some money. I sure could use it!

Anyway, if you're seeing this on a spam blog, my blog is called West Karana, and it's at .., and wouldn't you rather read it without any ads?
