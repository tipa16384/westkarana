Reposted from my [Shapeshifter](http://shewhoshapes.wordpress.com/) blog.Â I do plan to post more here -- in fact, I'm going to start posting daily, Just been really busy lately.

Anyway, enjoy a little Shapeshifter fan-fiction :PÂ

I had gotten what I thought was an easy level 54 puzzle, and let Kvho have a shot at it, certain heâ€™d be done with it in no time. Hours later, nothing. Puzzled, I let Shifter at it â€” STUMPED!

I went back to the Ixi for more puzzles, found an easier version, showed it to Shifter and Shifter had no idea what to do with it.

â€œUmmâ€¦ what is this, again?â€, she asked, turning it around, trying to guess the purpose of this random square of symbols.

â€œItâ€™s the Shapeshifter puzzle,â€ I said. I couldnâ€™t believe she was pulling this stuff on me. â€œI wrote you to SOLVE it. Donâ€™t give me this crap.â€

â€œYeah. Yeah, okay. Solve this. You bet.â€ She paused. â€œAnd just how would I go about this, then?â€

â€œDonâ€™t start this. I wrote you. Poured my soul into you. Spliced alien genes into you. Furchrissakes *parallelized* you! This is your life, Shifter. Now solve this thing.â€

â€œNuh uh. Todayâ€™s Friday. Iâ€™m really busy, full day ahead. Tomorrow, maybe tomorrow, I see if I remember anything about this â€˜Shapeshifterâ€™ puzzle.â€

â€œWhateverâ€, I said. Go to Hell and die, I thought to myself.

â€œKVHO!â€ I yelled. â€œGet in here.â€

He came oozing into the room, pale yellow eyes aglow, smirking. â€œSo. Now you need meâ€¦ againâ€¦ and I am to come at your call? After that puzzle last night you should beâ€¦ ashamed. This timeâ€¦ I require paymentâ€¦ we discussed this.â€

Payment. But not money, or food, or power. Kvho demands Shifterâ€™s very soul. He will stay until Shifter is dead, her uniqueness absorbed into his essence â€” the Borg of puzzle solvers. The form he wears, he modeled after Shifter. He hungers for more.

â€œPayment you will have. Solve this puzzle.â€

He took the random collection of symbols, set in an eight-by-eight square. â€œAndâ€¦ how am I to do this?â€

â€œDonâ€™t start with me.â€

Thatâ€™s how I left it when I came to work this morning. Shifter slunk away, Kvho seeing what he can do with the puzzle. Kvho can be stumped; he isnâ€™t the super-being he thinks he is. If neither can get anywhere with it, Iâ€™ll go hunting for easier puzzles tonight.
