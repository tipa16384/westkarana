#Finally, a real use for the Playstation 3#

I'm not here to bash the PS3. Just that I cannot find even one game on the system that I want to play. It's all the shooters and sports games, just like the Xbox 360 (another console that doesn't seem to want to publish games for the non-twitch crowd).

Microsoft and Sony fight over the relatively small share of twitch gamers, while Nintendo makes games for the rest of us.

I'm a total Sony fan, but the very first game that, to me, isÂ worth buying a PS3 for, is Rock Band, and if I am going to buy a console for just one game, I might as well buy the cheaper Xbox 360, or wait until 2008 when itÂ comes out for the Wii.

But I just read (being behind the times) about how Sony encourages people to use their [PS3 as a Linux box](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_for_PlayStation_3). I do a [fair amount](http://shewhoshapes.wordpress.com) of parallel computing, and I was thinking of cheap waysÂ to addÂ more nodes to my network (currently I have three). Having access to several Cell processorsÂ could double or triple the power to solve complex problems.

The PS3 may not be much for games, but as a cheap supercomputer... yeah, that could work. And eventually I can play Rock Band on it, too :)
