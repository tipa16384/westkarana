#SOE: DC Universe Online#

SOE posted a cattle call for [experienced game developers](http://sonyonline.recruitmax.com/candidate/default.cfm?szTemplate=3&szOrderID=1780&szCandidateID=0&szSearchWords=) on their career site for "[DC Universe Online](http://ps3.ign.com/objects/755/755358.html)". According to the ad, they plan to have it run both on the PC and the PS3. Doing it on such different architectures is pretty tricky -- Square-Enix tried porting their FFXI Online to the PC and what they got was a PC game that felt like a PS2 game (and was best played with a PS2 game controller at that).

Will SOE be able to pull off a fun game where PC players have a PC experience, and console players a console experience? Will they be able to develop it portably enough to also offer the game on the Macintosh and Linux? Will they go for a browser-based game and be everywhere?

I guess we'll find out in a couple of years.
