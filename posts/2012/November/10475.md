I have backed a couple of games, like the Defense Grid kickstarter, because there were modest, attainable goals and there was a sincerity vibe. It felt like something was going to really come of it. And they have totally followed through post-funding. Good stuff.

But my standard response to most of these is to think, "Sounds great! Let me know when it is on Steam and has a few reviews and I will consider giving you my money then."

My thoughts echo Wilhelms, especially the final line.

**Zubon** writes: The other keyword missing is "retro." It's a retro RTS MMO that combines the best of StarCraft, Master of Magic, and Excitebike to bring you an epic feeling unlike any other. Someone on the team used to do tech support near EA's headquarters!
