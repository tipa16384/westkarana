# Wizard101: A Puzzle of a Puzzler

*Posted by Tipa on 2012-03-23 20:43:58*

I don't spend a LOT of time in my homes in Wizard101, so I'm not sure exactly when I got some new artwork. Maybe someone can help fit these pieces together?

This piece looks to be a corner piece... those are always the best pieces to start with! Definitely part of the Wizard101 logo; it kinda looks like a piece of the old Celestia art... but it couldn't be that.

This one's a real mystery. It looks like sand or stone. Part of the right edge. Edge pieces are good, especially if they fit into a corner piece. These two pieces don't go together. Maybe if I turned the second one around... and used a hammer and some tape... hmmmm....

I've heard rumors of other pieces in other places... There's a mystery here!
