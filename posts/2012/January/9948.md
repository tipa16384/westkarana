EQ Emulator now works with versions of EverQuest *I actually have* now!

So anyway I still have some configuring to do before I can regress back to 1999. And I'm playing it through my LAN to where the files are stored on my Linux server because I had some crazy idea that I could play it in Wine. That wasn't happening.

More later. Sleep now.

Which versions does it work with now? I still have my original disc from 1999. You'd think that would work...
