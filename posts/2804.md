# Spinal Tap "Unwigged and Unplugged" coming to town!

May 22, 2009, Spinal Tap "[Unwigged](http://www.unwigged.com/)" is [coming to the Foxwoods Casino](http://tinyurl.com/d5js4t), one the of the two Indian resort casinos here in Connecticut. This is Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer as ... themselves ... and they'll also be playing some of their songs from "A Mighty Wind".

Grrr. Ever since I moved to Connecticut, I had promised myself I was never going to support gambling by going down to Foxwood or Mohegan Sun (the other one) and seeing one of their incredibly overpriced acts.

But... I'm not sure I can resist going to see THIS one.
