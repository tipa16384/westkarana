# Vista update: Maybe I'll finally be able to play EverQuest again...

According to [this post](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070807-vista-performance-and-compatibility-packs-released.html) over at Ars Technica, Vista will be pushing a couple of updates that should, among other things, make games work better under Vista.

I haven't been able to play EverQuest (1) since I got my Vista laptop -- it just refuses to get past the patcher. It's clearly crashing when EQ tries to change video modes, something that works fine on every other game, but not EQ. The update claims to fix a bug in nVidia laptop cards (mine has an 8600 in it). So... maybe I'll be able to play EQ again without having to take my Linux box offline to reboot it into Windows XP, which I have installed just for things like this. And 2-boxing.

Anyway, here's hoping. I haven't reformatted my laptop yet, just because I feel strongly I'll end up with a dead laptop missing drivers not available on my Windows XP disk. But if this patch doesn't work, I won't have much of a choice. I'll just have to be sure and remember to make a CD with the XP SATA drivers before I do anything irreversible.
