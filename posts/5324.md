Even though you no longer have to do the Celestia pre-quest in order to eventually head to that undersea expansion when it arrives later this year, why wouldn't you want to, right?

The pre-quest has you fighting bosses in Krokotopia, Mooshu and Dragonspyre in order to assemble a Rosetta stone that will allow the deciphering of a mysterious message. The message is from a lost Marleybone expedition into lost Celestia in search of the truth to rumors about Astral Magic.

Though we can't get to Celestia yet, the guardians of Celestia's spiral key plan to ensure we never can. This leads to a tower in Marleybone modeled after the Briskbreeze tower in Colossus Blvd; many floors, and two boss encounters who break the rules.

Each fight has a strategy, but even knowing the strategy is no guarantee of success. In the final fight against Estrakir Gloomthorn last night, accompanied by [the famous Thomas Lionblood](http://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/), Bailey Skystaff and my balance alt, Allison Goldtalon, I hadn't drawn any of my group heals, so, at the few points in the encounter where it is safe to heal, I was reduced to using spot heals -- and mostly on myself, which is a clear danger sign. I finally managed to score some rebirths just as Thomas and Bailey were ready with their big spells. I believe we even finished the tower with full health.

All the mobs but Estrakir immediately respawned for some reason, so... we killed them again.

We tried to keep everyone in the same spaces for the duels. I sent Allison, the balance wizard, in first. As the first to cast, she would be able to send buffs to the wizard that needed them most. Tara, my life wizard, took the second spot to again be in the best spot for healing. Thomas and Bailey, the ones who would need healing and buffs the most, would be in the third and fourth spots.

Worked really well!

If, though, Celestia towers are built on this model, groups are going to have to get used to working with strats and perhaps certain required classes. I think it would be possible to do this tower without a life wizard, with everyone using self-heals and perhaps someone with a life secondary passing out satyrs as necessary, but it would be tougher.

More worrisome, like Briskbreeze, the Ravens and the Grand Spire, it is probably impossible to finish the encounter with only one or two wizards, even with wizard hirelings (who are nearly worthless, in my experience).

I'm weird, though. I hope every boss encounter in Celestia is of this level. But then, I play a life wizard :P
