Interested in French MMOs but Saga of Ryzom isn't enough for you? You're in luck, because comedy-action F2P MMO Dungeon Party [goes live today](http://www.dungeon-party.com/index.php?rub=news_info), so download the client and get treasure hunting!

Is it good? I have no idea. I couldn't get the beta client to launch on my computer, but maybe they fixed it.
