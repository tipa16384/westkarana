# SUWT #12

[Shut Up, We're Talking! #12](http://commonsensegamer.com/?p=495) is up. I had the pleasure of being part of it, along with Grimwell (SOE EQ2 Community Manager) and Tom-Tom from [Gamer's Mind](http://www.gamersmind.org/).

Thanks, Darren, for being such an awesome host! Darren really knows how to keep the discussion going and moving to interesting places. I was positive I'd have nothing to say :P
