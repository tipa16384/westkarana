# McCain Wins!

I'm a "Hillary Democrat", so that means I should vote for McCain, right?

Well, you know, back when I lived in California, I really respected him. He really DOES work both sides of the aisle, and is a true bipartisan. Until he decided to abandon his long-held positions in order to gain the support of the Republican base, when once they barely considered him Republican at all. And then he accepted the dragging anchor that the RNC saddled him with as a running mate.

Apparently a lot of the country agrees.

Looking at the projections from this first hour of Election Day, when the nation's first polling place in Republican-dominated Dixville Notch, NH has opened and closed and handed their votes overwhelmingly to Obama, and Obama seems certain to be our next President...

Wouldn't it just be cool if McCain really DID make all the polls and projections look silly and WIN?

Don't get me wrong. I think Obama ~~would~~ will be a great President. I also believe that McCain, if he won, would drop the right wing clothes he reluctantly wears and would govern how he wanted, the RNC be damned. So either way this goes, I'll be okay.

When everyone goes in one direction, I just can't help but wonder what's down the other path.

I guess that's just the contrarian inside me talking.
