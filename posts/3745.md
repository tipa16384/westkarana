#Wizard 101: The Ghost of Mrs. Malistaire#

Deciding to see if a treasure card like "Quench" could stop Malistaire from casting Meteor Storm all the time, Thomas the Friendly Necromancer and I took ourselves and our alts to the Great Spyre to see if we could figure out the puzzle of Wizard 101's ultimate encounter.

Aside from the forge outside the instance, we didn't find anything unusual. Inside were some harvests -- some ore and lava flowers -- and two of us received ectoplasm (a new crafting reagent) from the spirits that protected Malistaire -- but nothing suggested itself as a counter to Malistaire's spells. None of the treasure card recipes seemed to make anything that would reflect his spells back on him.

Thomas suggested getting our fire resists incredibly high. If we were able to get our resists above 100%, his meteor storm would do nothing to us -- but we would be so weakened without our gear that he could kill us in some other way. He has, after all, got 100,000 health. We have to be able to do 100,000 damage to him.

And though he no longer has his three spirit companions, he now summons his dead wife, Sylvia, to his side.

Malistaire cannot be stunned or interrupted, it seems.

The fight goes in cycles. Malistaire starts off by casting his meteor storm. Every time he casts it, it gets more damaging.

Then he seems to do a normal attack. The next round, he summons Sylvia. She spends a turn casting a minor buff on Malistaire, then a fire shell around the dueling circle, then a buff that gives every player maximum power pips, then she disappears while Malistaire erases the fire shell with a death shell, I believe. Malistaire casts his meteor storm again and it continues.

The key seems to be in the use of 'X' pip spells, that gain power with every pip spent. Four fire wizards casting Heckhound at the appropriate time with blades, fire shell, fire traps and feints up, should be able to kill Malistaire in about eight rounds.

While I think he can be killed in that way, a real solution wouldn't be so dependent on certain wizards casting certain spells. Especially since you likely still have to kill him at least a half dozen times for your robe -- if he is exceedingly hard to do, nobody will be willing to help.

We're getting closer now that we know more about the encounter, but there's something we're still missing.
