Thanks to Emily from Neopets who kept working with me until I remembered enough details of what I had in Neopets so that she could send me the info I needed to log in again.

Spitefur is staying in a luxury hotel the next five days until she gets back to good health.

Now to take a look at Shapeshifter again...
