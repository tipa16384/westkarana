# Wizard 101: St. Patty's day -- and new Crowns items!

A funny little man dressed in green dragged me to my computer. "Log in! To Wizard 101!" he insisted. And when I started to do just that, he slapped my hands rudely from the keyboard. "No! Log in to the TEST SERVER! There all the new St. Patty's Day things you will see!"

"Gee," I said. "Thanks, Yoda."

I did find the new St. Patty's Day stuff. But I also stopped in on my friend Zeke the Prospector and found that he now carried new items for the discriminating shopper.

First, St. Patty's new wands. That's right, no new clothes from him, and the St. Valentine's Day gal hadn't brought any either. This is a GOOD THING, since until we have appearance slots to show a different outfit than the one that gives us stats, buying an outfit with no stats is not wise.

The wands cast Life magic, and as is usual now, come in different powers for different levels, so you can always find a wand that's good for your level. Wand? Heck, you can get an IRISH HARP!

The Prospector Zeke in Dragonspyre now sells level 45+ Crowns clothes, athames and rings. These are unusual in that they are not specifically an UPGRADE from the level 35+ items sold in Moo Shu, and they are certainly well below the level of many ordinary drops in Dragonspyre itself. Is this an effort to make the Crowns items less of a "must buy" for each new world? It's likely -- but it's weird that they aren't a real upgrade from the Moo Shu stuff.

I've bought the Moo Shu crown clothes, so here's a comparison between the stuff from Moo Shu and the corresponding Dragonspyre stuff. Click on the images to see them full-size.
