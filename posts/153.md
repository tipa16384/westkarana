# Nektulos Forest (Re-)Revisited

![](../images/newnek1.jpg)



I'm not a fan of what they did to some of the old classic EQ1 zones with the Depths of Darkhollow and Prophecy of Ro. What possibly reason is there to take the old cities and forests we loved for all their faults and simplicity and make them crushingly dark, ugly and depressing?



Nektulos Forest, in particular, was transformed into a maze surrounded by fake forest you couldn't even walk through.



SOE hardly ever admits mistakes. But they did this time. They changed Nektulos back to the old map, but with the new models for monsters and trees. So everything is where it was -- where it *should* be.



The EQ1 devs have just got to face the facts here. EQ1 is an old game, and a powerful reason why people still play is nostalgia - for many of us, this was our first serious MMORPG. Being able to 'go back home' to our old newbie fields is something we want to do. Make things look nicer, sure - but don't stomp all over what keeps us here.



Anyway, kudos to the devs. Now, I'll let you make my old Misty Thicket nicer. But if you're going to destroy Rivervale like you destroyed Freeport, please pass on by.
