# Spaceport in New Mexico

Just reading this story about Virgin Galactic builing a [spaceport in New Mexico](http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/space/12/08/virgin.space.reut/index.html) brings me back to my childhood, reading those Heinlein stories and dreaming about the future.

I am glad to be alive when the 'future' is happening.

On the same page as that story, were stories about the accelerating erosion of one of the largest glaciers in the world due to climate change, the Great Lakes in danger, and the United States refusing to join the world in reducing global-warming gas emission.

Do we deserve the future?
