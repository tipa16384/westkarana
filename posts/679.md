#LotRO: Finished Book III#

Yes, I *am* rushing through Lord of the Rings Online. There's way too much exciting stuff happening in EverQuest 2 to stay away much longer; the release of Neriak and the dark Fae; Kunark coming in the fall; LotRO has to be done and finished by then.

Book 3 deals with the fight of the Dunadain -- the Rangers -- against the tide of evil creatures coming from the North. They have taken over the ancient city of Fornost and are spread throughout the plains of Dol Dinan.



Chapter 1 is just finding the Ranger stronghold of Esteldin. Chapter 2 sends you to the ruins of Fornost to scout out the place and take down some orcs and wargs while there. Chapter 3, 4 and 5 are calls to the Men, Dwarves and Elves to come to a council in Esteldin; these can be done in any order, but most everyone does Dwarves (Saving Dori), Man (Defending Trestlebridge), and Elf (I've forgotten the name of it :P)

Saving Dori goes to the same ruins outside Othrikar filled with elite dwarves who are holding a good dwarf (wait, there are *good ones*?) who would definitely go to the council if he were, like, free. But the bad dwarves have filled his calendar with progress meetings, working lunches, video conferences and strategy sessions. Our job was to cut all the red tape and free him from his cubicle deep inside the dwarf fortress.

The Men of Trestlebridge would LOVE to come, except orcs just HAD to pick this time to come a-raiding. And maybe if we could take a few minutes and just kill a few hundred of them, well, maybe they could see their way clear to sending a rep to the council. This is an instance taking place entirely in the trestle bridge outside Trestlebridge. Pretty fun, not that hard.

The Elves are eager to attend but they, too, have an orc problem; pretty much the same orcs that need to die for the Black-fire quests. Black-fire. Oh, is that their name for gunpowder? Why does every fantasy work have someone who "discovers" gunpowder but feels the need to give it a silly name? "Boomdust!" "Talcum of Death!" "Black-fire!" "Fire dirt!"... whatever.

Forty seven hours later... loooong run.... Gandalf says, "Hi! Here's Book 4! You'll notice it's red to you! Bye! Stablemaster won't rent you a horse so run, fool, RUUUUUNNNN!"

It's a short book. Five more to go, I think.

Someone wrote that no matter what armor they got, it all kinda matched and never looked patchwork.

I think I've proven that wrong here.

I would have made level 32 tonight but they took the server down, so I went onto EQ2 and finished my Shimmering Citadel access quest.

Huh? What do you mean, you can get in without it???
