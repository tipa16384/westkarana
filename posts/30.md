# Kanda is 50

Not bad progress for a character I had quit. Just over a month from 1 to 50.

Distressed at possibly repeating a mistake I had made in EQ of joining a guild in a very different time zone that made it impossible to get to raids until hours after they began, I planned to restart on the new Aussie server. At 9PM Pacific time, they're just getting started. No rushing at all, ever, to raid or group at a good time.

But Kayllistul urged me to return to Kirin Tor and try his guild, The Compendium, out. It was hard to leave friends in Ghost Watch, but I am having more fun now.

What the heck is that? Seen in Felwood.

Sure, this dragon is a 40 MAN raid, but it only takes a troll and a deader!

Uh-huh.
