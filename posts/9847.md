# DCUO: It's a hard light

Okay, so in SOE's DC Universe Online, people are getting random superpowers by being infected with some superpower thing cooked up by Brainiac. You wake up one morning, you have superpowers. Maybe you have to escape from Brainiac's space ship, but whatever.

With DCUO's Lords of Light (or whatever) expansion pack, you can have Green Lantern or Sinestro's powers. Including a power ring. Note power ring on my character below.

Soooooo where'd the power ring come from? 

I played DCUO in beta. I even pre-ordered it and put down a $5 deposit on it, but after working my way through the first quest line, I was so bored I never bought the game, that $5 was just wasted.

It's free now, though, and people I know are playing it, so I told Steam to send it to me while I was off taking pictures of bridges in the rain today (yay!). It was finished downloading by the time I got home. I started it up and immediately got a message from +[Eric Redman](https://plus.google.com/113866940190428695218) asking if I'd be interested in creating an evil, Sinestro-type character and joining his guild.

Well, duh. Being a Green Lantern is the only thing I ever wanted from DCUO, and was a key reason in my disappointment in beta. The Sinestro Corps is just like the Green Lantern Corps, just yellower.

As a Station Pass subscriber, I even got the Phosphorescent Photons (whatever) expansion free, so I made my character with Sinestro as my mentor (which gave me all his powers and, apparently, his ring, which I imagine he'll miss in a bit), popped into the tutorial mission and kicked butt.

Later on, Lex Luthor stopped by and helped me kick butt. All along I was being shepherded around by a mysterious person who was interested in getting me off the ship for no apparent reason.

I met up with Eric's character. He modeled super outfits for me and shot me with a gunship. You know, he's a bad guy, he does stuff like that.

He helped me out with a small project to corrupt local university students by forcing them into Occupy Metropolis movements, and then infecting them with mutagens. Bwahahaha. That eventually got us joined up with the supervillain Parasite to capture Power Girl and force her to put on some clothing. And steal some of her DNA.

She's the cousin of Superman in this game. I thought Supergirl was Superman's cousin?

Is DCUO suddenly interesting because it is F2P? Well, it was always part of the Station Pass, so I'd never be paying anything additional to play the game. The controller/combo-based gameplay is something I find tiring if forced to do it very long. The game seems designed to be a pick-up-and-play game. Can DCUO be fun for thirty minutes a day?

Maybe.

Will I still be playing it in two weeks?

That's the real question.
