# TO DO list

I need a way to organize my time while at work. I'm constantly thinking there is something I should be doing, and actually having ten things I must do, and only getting to a couple because I can't prioritize.

I used to use Outlook to do this, both here and before at Cypress Grove. I changed to Thunderbird both at work and at home for various reasons; I especially liked TBird's spam filters. But I lost the TO DO list.

[Konfabulator](../../../www.konfabulator.com) (pictured above; calendar and NH weather on my desktop) comes with a TO DO list, but I find it needlessly ugly (ooooo 3D ooooo). I want one like Outlook. I'll keep looking.

When I find one, maybe I can stop hating myself for not getting to things I need to do.
