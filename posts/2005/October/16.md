# Microsoft Tool to rate Game Performance

This is an interesting little web page (requires IE) that scans your hardware and tells you how well it could play any of a number of games.



My work computer can play EQ, it says, but WoW is a no-no.

I just flashed back to Antonica near Thundering Steppes. Why does that place hold memories... why does any place in any virtual world bring me back. Running to Cotswold at bard speed in DAoC; exploring the mysteries of the Misty Thicket in EQ; relaxing among the autumn leaves in the forest outside San D'Oria in FFXI.



I'm trying to think of one for WoW, and I guess it would be that inn in Ashenvale where Sylvanar and I logged off for the last time in Beta.
