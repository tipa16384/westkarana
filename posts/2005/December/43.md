# Spellborn Chronicles

*Posted by Tipa on 2005-12-08 00:00:00*

Always on the lookout to find new things to which to become addicted, I've been keeping an eye on [The Spellborn Chronicles](http://www.thechroniclesofspellborn.com/scrolls/?id=scroll1). A close call with its forums left me with an unending stream of information about it courtesy of Google Desktop's automatic feed subscriber.

Games that take over your life for years and years are a thing of the past. The current rage is like WoW - a game you play for a year and then move on.

There are so many good things about this game; its roots in heroic fantasy and so on that made D&D so entrancing but was lost along the way to EQ and WoW.

Just the fact that you will be able to look the way you want to look is pretty fun.

I don't know much about it yet, but it sounds intriguing. Actually, parts of it remind me of my old Timespan campaign from the 80s.... maybe that's why I am looking forward to it.

Hmm. I wrote a program today. So I guess I still can! If you can call a web application programming. And if you can call JavaScript a programming language :P
