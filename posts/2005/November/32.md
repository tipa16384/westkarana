# Dealing with Farmers

Occasionally, on EQ, I'd run across a farmer. But not that often; the last time I really interacted with farmers were the ones farming Sleeper's Tomb for cash items on Stromm. And they spoke English. And were pissed we woke the Sleeper.....

WoW.... is filled with farmers. And they don't hide away, they are everywhere you go. I get linked items or have things put in my trade window from them all the time, in cities. And if I am trying to complete quests in places where valuable tradeskill items drop, whoa be unto me. I have been trained by farmers in Badlands, Felwood and Azshara so far, and from what I understand, it's wall-to-wall farmer in the Plaguelands.
