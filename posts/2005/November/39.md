# Net PBM

*Posted by Tipa on 2005-11-03 00:00:00*

Waaay back in prehistory, while working on developing graphical video and printer drivers for DRI's Flex/OS, I chanced upon a really cool UNIX package that would transfer almost any kind of graphic file to any other kind. These packages really helped get test images ready to view in my sample CGA and EGA drivers.

I was looking for them awhile ago to help do certain kinds of things and conversions for the [CE News](http://ce.westkarana.com/). I bought a package to do these things under Windows, but that company did not have an equivalent package for Linux, when I changed OSs.

Well, now I've found [NetPBM](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/), and can hardly wait to start playing with it again.
