#Wordpress & the San Diego Comic-Con#

Whilst poking around Friday, I found a nice Ruby script which converted from Simple PHP Blog, which I'd been using, to Wordpress, which... is what this is. I have been building a custom theme for Wordpress but it is far from done. Also all the categories have been flummoxed... still, it is a beginning.

Argh... half the articles have been cut off midway. I'll have to fix the script and redo this...

My son and I were going to go to the San Diego Comic Convention today. Well, we *did* go... we just didn't get in. Half an hour to get to the area; an hour wait for a shuttle bus that wasn't full; two hours waiting in line only to be told it would be another 3-4 hours before they could let us in.

I got horribly sunburned since I was wearing a tank top and didn't expect to be standing in the sun for two hours. My skin is transparent white. Cave fish underbelly white. Copy paper white.

But now it's raw and red.

We're going to try again tomorrow.
