#Don't bring a knife to a HAMMER fight, Jack Sparrow!#

![Scottie Dog vs Jack Sparrow in My Brute.](http://westkarana.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/fullscreen-capture-6112009-72334-am.jpg "Scottie Dog vs Jack Sparrow in My Brute.")

This will go down in history as the day when Scottie Dog defeated Captain Jack Sparrow.

In My Brute, anyway. (PS -- click here to roll up a Brute and [become one of A Dire Bear's pupils](http://a-dire-bear.mybrute.com)).

Finally got to level 10 with A Dire Bear, btw, and made a new clan, [Clan Nostalgia the Clan](http://mybrute.com/team/47928). So that's ANOTHER game we're in :)
