#Being Rock Bandidextrous#

Wanderlust's "I Walked" comes on the MP3 player and I think how wonderful that song would be with Rock Band. I should Audiosurf it.

Last night, I strapped a microphone to a broom handle with hair ties, took up plastic guitar and was a one-woman band for awhile; singing and playing guitar at the same time. 

It definitely helps if you know the words to the song in advance. ALL the words. Trying to read lyrics as they sped past, keep my pitch correct AND keep the guitar going was a little harder than I expected, but it felt so good to finish a verse, lean back from the mike and go into a blistering guitar solo for a few moments... it was 10x more fun than either singing or guitar alone.

I can't see singing while playing drums instead of the guitar. Not because drums are harder (though they are), but because playing the drums is almost Zen-like for me -- singing would just cheapen it.

Especially *my* singing.
