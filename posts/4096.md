# Happy Birthday, Wizard101!

Back in July of 2008, I downloaded a new MMO, played for several hours, and barely managed [to tear myself away long enough to write about this still-in-beta Wizard101](http://westkarana.com/index.php/2008/07/10/1688/):


> It’s not the “perfect” MMO, but it’s definitely different enough to make it worth a look. Deck-building, strategic card-playing, turn-based combat? Check. Automatic grouping? Check. An absolutely INSANE amount of character customization? Check. A Toon Town-ish gameplay style that lets kids and adults play safely together? Check. Friggin’ baby dragon pets? Oh dear, yes, check!



I could tell right away that this game not only was something special, but was also a validation of indie game studios. The big guys fear innovation; they want an established IP, they don't want to surprise anyone, and they have their eyes fixed firmly on getting some of those elusive WoW-bucks.

Wizard101 had a funny and sometimes sad story to it; a man driven past his breaking point by the death of his wife, willing to destroy everything in order to bring her back. Young wizards sent to retrace his steps through world after world. And at the heart of it, a card game that appears at first to be rock-paper-scissors simple, but becomes incredibly strategic.

In the past year, KingsIsle has released two major expansions -- Dragonspyre, which finished the main plot, and Grizzleheim, which introduced a parallel mystery for younger wizards and also -- player housing! KI changed the loot given for defeating bosses and completing quests so that any given wizard would have dozens of items to show off in their home! Want several homes? No problem.

After I finished the main plot, leveled to max level, and got all my gear, I thought I'd probably take a break from Wizard101. But I couldn't do it. The game is just too fun, even now, and I really wanted to play in Grizzleheim and see Marleybone -- hands down my favorite world -- again.

I tell pretty much everyone who asks me what the best MMO for a casual player might be, and I always point them toward this game. A surprising number of those people play a little, play a little more, play a little more, get a few new cards -- and they are hooked.

I can point to half a dozen subscription MMOs which have only a fraction of Wizard101's community. This game has inspired dozens of players to take up blogging to chronicle their adventures. Wizard101 Central is the liveliest and most helpful forum I've seen in years. The development and community staff are some of the friendliest and most approachable people it's ever been my pleasure to talk to.

It's a perfect storm of MMO development, is what it is.

So, happy birthday, Wizard101! I can't wait to see what you have cooking inside those cloistered Austin offices. Celestia, right? And what's that secret project you have going there?
