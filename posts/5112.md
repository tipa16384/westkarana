Massively.com's Rubi had been hinting all day at something special for the Wednesday DDO meetup (9PM EDT, all are invited)... The big secret? We were going to explore some of the paid content in Dungeons & Dragons Online, courtesy of a double armload of 90-minute guest passes.

I bought a pile of guest passes and we did Tangleroot. Much fun was had.[less than a minute ago](http://twitter.com/Rubi_/status/13464161058 "Thu May 06 02:48:12 +0000 2010") via web[![](http://s.twimg.com/a/1273086425/images/default_profile_5_normal.png)](http://twitter.com/Rubi_)**[Rubi\_](http://twitter.com/Rubi_)**

 

Though I usually am just content to get some of my solo quests out of the way to get ready for the Sunday group, tonight... tonight I wanted to be part of the special event. So I hung out in the Bleeding Stump Tavern, or the Sucking Leg Wound Saloon or whatever it's called, got a group, and debated what to do about the *destination de la nuit*, Tangleroot Gorge.

That's an adventure pack I didn't have, AND I just bought another adventure pack, Sharn Syndicate, last week. Rubi had bought a few guest passes (at 50 Turbine Points each), but I decided to take the plunge and just buy the adventure pack.

Both purchases combined don't even come to one month's subscription to some other title, and I've been playing DDO for a few months now. I've said many times that if I like a F2P game, I have no problem at all spending money in its cash shop. The developers have to eat, too! Still an absolute bargain.

Tangleroot Gorge is a huge wilderness area within which sits an equally massive dungeon. A long quest series sends you through that dungeon many times, each time exploring a little further, until the final mission which sends you to kill the leader. All very standard stuff, actually -- the fun was in the company, and the loot wasn't bad. I scored some rather nice boots from it, and got clerical advice from the group leader, which was much appreciated.

Afterward, I joined Kasul in Korthos Island, where we knocked off the Cannith Aqueduct mission on Elite. As in the normal difficulties, the Skeletal Mage was the only difficult encounter. He was too much for both of us, but my cleric hireling managed to finish the fight and get me standing. Dwarf cleric, of course. The reliable kind.

So, it was another fun night! Thanks to Rubi, Syp, and the rest of the Massively crew for organizing it, thanks to Kasul and my groupmates, and looking forward to playing again Sunday and next week!
