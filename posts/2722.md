# Gatheryn -- is this the Steampunk game for the rest of us?

Yesterday [I wrote about "Neo Steam"](http://westkarana.com/index.php/2009/02/24/atlus-neo-steam-f2p-fantasy-steampunk-mmo/), which brings a decidedly Eastern, hardcore PvP, flair to that eternal conflict between technology and magic and the mystical substance that powers them both.

Intriguing? Yes, maybe, but -- it isn't Steampunk! Not to me, anyway. Just having a mystical substance called "Neo Steam" is not enough to make it Steampunk in my book. If it were called "Neo Granite", would that make it "Quarry Punk"?

Hey... actually... read it here first, okay?

[Tesh](http://tishtoshtesh.wordpress.com/) left a comment in that post pointing me to another Steampunk game called [The World of Gatheryn](http://www.mindfusegames.com/).

There's not much detail on the site, aside from concept art like the one at the top of this post, but ... come on, this is Steampunk.

> Step back in time to a place and era that never quite existed. Where steam engines trundle down the avenues and vendors hawk their wares! The sounds, the sights, the mysteries - all await you and your friends.

Come, journey to Gatheryn, a massive multi-player world of adventure, mystery and romance. Make your way through an ever expanding world, making new friends and enemies as you work through interactive games and puzzles, new adventures appearing with each successful solution. You can hop aboard the nearest air ship to reach a myriad of destinations or just to satisfy the explorer inside you.

Assume any of various roles of Victorian themed characters as you explore, socialize and quest your way through this amazing world. Scurry along the wharves and climb the riggings on wooden tall ships the likes of which you have never experienced before. Traipse along the avenues or skulk through the cemetery as the full moon lights your way. This is a time and place of mysteries to be unraveled and puzzles to be conquered, of land to explore and life to be LIVED!!



A social MMO ... set in the Victorian era ... with steam-powered machines walking around and even steam-powered pets?

This -- could be fantastic. I can't wait to see if they can pull it off. They are collecting email addresses for a newsletter and possible beta opportunities on their website, so if evenings spent chatting in the Queen's summer audience chamber might appeal to you, give it a shot!

They still appear to be really early in development, though.
