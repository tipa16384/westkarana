# If you just want to find anything, Cuill sucks.

Everyone's excited about the new search site "[Cuill.com](http://cuill.com)", just because they are burning their venture capital on caviar-filled bathtubs or whatever and it was started by ex-Google employees.

Personally, I have yet to find anything I was looking for on that site. Like, just today, I wanted to see how well the personal finance program Quicken was doing in getting ported to Linux, perhaps via the WINE software that can bring many Windows programs to the Linux desktop. My son's going off to college and I will need a very strict budget. So I typed "linux wine quicken" into a few search engines.

[Searching via Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=linux+wine+quicken) brings up its usual results screen, and the very first entry is one about [running Quicken 2007 under WINE](http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/wine/106875-quicken-2007-wine.html). Excellent.

I typed [the same words into Searchme](http://www.searchme.com/#/0/&pi=1/&q=linux%20wine%20quicken/)e and the first entries were about Crossover, the commercial version of WINE, and its adventures with Quicken.

[I tried it in Cuill](http://www.cuil.com/search?q=linux+wine+quicken) and... two entries from some guy about how he installed Ubuntu a few years back, a list of packages for SuSE 10 (a version of Linux) that had nothing to do with Quicken, and six spam pages that are just long lists of keywords meant to entrap search engines.

Because I like reading about myself as much as anyone, I did an ego search on me with [my name followed by MMO](http://www.cuil.com/search?q=brenda%20holloway%20mmo&sl=long), because there was a 60s soul singer who shares my name who gets all the love. And every result (which was largely everything I wrote at Massively) has a different picture of the *famous* person next to it. 

Just... not feeling it for Cuill.

Almost forgot to post this... got too into flipping through Searchme pages. I love Searchme.
