Computer on, online, but AFK while at work today. Today, while I am converting bond letters at work, my DOMO character will be doing a LOT of harvesting -- this is designed in to DOMO, it's not an exploit. In fact, DOMO will even log you out when you've harvested as much as you can, which is nice of them.

I'm ALSO downloading a very large MMO that I can't talk about yet. So, busy day for me, busy day for my computer...

So anyway, /afk, back in a few hours.
