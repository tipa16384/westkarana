# Divinity II don't care what class you are

Just because my character is wearing plate armor and swinging a two-handed sword doesn't mean she isn't a mean spell caster, because she is. Magic users in Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga would kick a D&D magic user's butt to the gates of hell and back. It's okay to make an entirely unbalanced character in a single player RPG; you are, after all, expected to save the world at some point.

It always comes down to saving the world.

The story in Divinity II is that my character isn't starting from scratch; the process that gave her Electric Glowing Slayer Vision removed her memories of her years of training, so essentially she is just remembering what a bad-ass she was the day before she stepped off the zeppelin.

She's okay with a sword, but her main power comes from magic missiles. They kill, they cost almost no mana and they don't need to be aimed. Melee is a matter so far of aggroing mobs, then ducking around a corner or behind a tree so that they can't range you to death. Standing in one place for long in Divinity II means death.

I've just gotten about as far in the real game as the demo took me; level 6 with just a couple more quests to complete in Broken Valley, which should level me enough (I hope) to buy the level 8 magical armor for sale before I head out to the deadlier world.

Anyway, background on this, the gamer circle has been working lately through Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga, so after I finished with Dragon Nest, I started on this.
