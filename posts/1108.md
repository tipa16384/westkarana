# Tomorrow: I must remember to bring the aqualung.

It's been months since I bought the tickets, and I have to remember that tomorrow is December 1st, and the Jethro Tull concert down in Wallingford.

I keep forgetting. Must remember.

I hope they let me take my camera in.

Tull will be accompanied by the Calliandra String Quartet. That made me a little nervous -- until I read [this wonderful review](http://blogs.timesunion.com/reviews/?p=310) of the show yesterday in Albany.

That's pretty frickin' amazing. They play yesterday, get reviewed, review goes up on the web site, so I know the show tomorrow is going to be fantastic.

I just hope I remember to GO!

Live Nation sent me a reminder to buy tickets to next April's Avril Lavigne concert... hmmm... how much do I like "Sk8ter Boi", anyway -- in dollars?
