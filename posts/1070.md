# EQ2: Karnor's Castle: It's not only me.

Kendricke over at Clockwork Gamer [has also noted](http://clockworkgamer.com/2007/11/15/kunark-field-report-i/) that the experience in Karnor's Castle is seriously out of whack, even going so far as to advise his guild *not* to bother going there.

SOE, you have a real problem here. Don't let all that beautiful zone design go to waste!
