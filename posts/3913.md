According to news sites [T-Online](http://spiele.t-online.de/c/19/47/40/86/19474086.html) and [GameZone](http://www.gamezone.de/news_detail.asp?nid=75821), Dutch-developed Fantasy MMORPG Chronicles of Spellborn will be shutting down the Frogster-operated European servers at the end of July. European players may have their characters transferred to the Acclaim-operated American servers by filling out [a form on the Acclaim site](http://spellborn.acclaim.com).

The article goes on to say that Spellborn will be relaunched in 2010 as a Free2Play game, funding itself with a cash store that will sell gear and character services. Upon relaunch, Frogster will again operate the European servers.
