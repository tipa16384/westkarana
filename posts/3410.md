#My favorite spam ever!#

I get a LOT of spam, most of it I just silently delete... but this one... this one is special. It's from Russia, and any email or offer or web site from Russia is a scam. The place is the world capital of scams. I'd hate to actually try using the Internet from within Russia, as the citizens of that fine country probably find they can't trust anything at all.

This spam discusses a super technology which has some magical properties...

> This unique Green technology is biodegradable, secure and its molecules are so microscopic that it can penetrate virtually any natural or manmade material, and break the bond between those materials and hydrocarbons. ... is being utilized to increase production 100 to 500% in marginal oil wells, and is also a silver bullet for property owners, as well as state and federal environmental agencies in the remediation of contaminated soil and water, making it possible for the first time to recover hydrocarbons and precious metals from soil that would otherwise be hauled away and burned to ash.


I was writing up all the ways that this spam was wrong, but it ties back into my screed last weekend about how [Star Trek Countdown](http://westkarana.com/index.php/2009/04/25/star-trek-countdown-taking-the-science-out-of-science-fiction/) didn't even TRY to use plausible science. This one is an obvious fail for anyone who ever took chemistry in high school, and a clear example of how [Russians consider Americans to be fecking idiots](http://blog.tanyakhovanova.com/?p=93).
