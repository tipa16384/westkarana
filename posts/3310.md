Welcome to the weekend! It's fantastic weather, so gonna keep this short.

More news about the ex-Mythos developers' new game, Torchlight? The Runic Games Fansite [has a FAQ](http://www.runicgamesfansite.com/torchlight-faq/) complete with everything they know about the fantasy Action RPG and its followup MMO, and Runic Games Insider's Taylor Balbi [has really long interviews](http://www.runicinsider.com/forums/showthread.php?t=74) with a few of the devs with the nittiest, grittiest details.

Keen at Keen and Graev has a [rather positive look at Free Realms](http://www.keenandgraev.com/?p=2262). It's a fun game, but will it appeal enough to kids to become a success?

Cryptic's Bill Roper says the newest Joker in the Superhero MMO deck (see what i did there?), Champions Online, [will be released July 14](http://www.strategyinformer.com/news/4062/champions-online-dated-releases-14th-july-2009-in-us-and-europe) -- Bastille Day. Syp of Bio Break [asks the questions that need answering](http://biobreak.wordpress.com/2009/04/24/champions-summer-domination/). Ardwulf wonders just [how much of the freedom to define powers](http://ardwulfslair.wordpress.com/2009/04/24/chapions-online-in-july/) has made the jump from PnP to MMO. 

MBP at Mind Bending Puzzles wonders if [the news that Wii sales have dropped off in Japan](http://www.joystiq.com/2009/04/06/nintendo-not-concerned-about-declining-japanese-wii-sales/) signal that [the craze for casual games is unsustainable](http://mindbendingpuzzles.blogspot.com/2009/04/how-simple-business-common-sense-will.html) because casual gamers don't get invested in their games. 

A simple trading mission in EVE Online in high security space went bad, and suddenly Enforcer was podkilled and out a billion ISK. Scopique at Cedarstreet figures some research or scouting the route ahead of time might have saved Enforcer the death, and wonders [how much research should developers expect from an MMO gamer](http://www.cedarstreet.net/2009/04/how-much-effort-do-you-put-into-your.html) before they play the game?

Psyq at Dalaran Diary talks about Shards of Dalaya's [House of Portals](http://dalayan.wordpress.com/2009/04/24/sod-innovation-no-2-mansion-of-portals/), the possibly deadly but always treacherous mansion used for long distance travel as opposed to EverQuest's spires or knowledge portals. I liked the Nexus spires introduced with Luclin. It made travel somewhat easier without making it trivial, provided a place for people to meet and gather and trade, and was a good improvement over the boats. The Plane of Knowledge removed most travel times, and Norrath grew smaller as a result. I'd love to try that House of Portals sometime!

See you tomorrow and have a gorgeous weekend!
