# Order of the Stick's tribute to Gary Gygax

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-03-05 07:04:20*

"Order of the Stick", the web comic about characters living in a D&D world (and well aware of the rules that govern their lives), did a [special tribute comic](http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0536.html) to Gary Gygax. Very touching :)

Oh yeah, here's [Penny Arcade's tribute](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic).
