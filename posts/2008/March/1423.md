# Gary Gygax, R.I.P.

Via [Zen of Design](http://www.zenofdesign.com/?p=1019), the sad news that Gary Gygax, the father of modern roleplaying games and the **co-**creator of Dungeons & Dragons, [has passed away](http://www.freeyabb.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=4373&mforum=trolllordgames).

He gathered together the ideas in a dozen or more fantasy books and showed us all how we could live our own adventures in those worlds.

The RPG and MMO industries owe him an incalculable debt. Without D&D, we'd all be doing something different right now.

See ya on the Astral Plane.
