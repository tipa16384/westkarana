# EQ1: Pics from pre-Alpha

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-03-01 08:19:45*

EQ1 wasn't always the raiding powerhouse game it is today. In fact, the game had very humble roots, with little in its first implementation to suggest the game it would become.

Still, it was fun and even at the beginning, was totally addicting.

Screenshots after the jump.

So shoot me :P

Just came across it while looking for old raid screenshots for another article. I made this when I was bored one day and didn't feel like posting yet another screenshot of us dying to grubs in Inktu'ta...

In fact one of the fights was running from ghosts -- one would start to come after you, and you had to run around the room until the raid killed it, because if it touched you, you DIED. And I think spawned another ghost too.

Ah, good old EC tunnel.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://westkarana.com/images/noff/ew.jpg">\r\n\r\nMinutes after plunging you to death at the entrance to Kael. Notice you STILL don't have SoE. Actually I'm not sure I had SoE then. I think all I had was a levitate/SoW combo, and levitate took a bat wing as a material component.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://westkarana.com/images/noff/kaesora.jpg">\r\n\r\nRemember this Kaesora trip? Kaesora has always been one of my favorite zones. Can you tell I spent a lot of time in Sol B?\r\n\r\n<img src="http://westkarana.com/images/noff/noff.jpg">\r\n\r\nStabbing Cara in ToFS. Did you ever get her dagger of bandages?\r\n\r\n<img src="http://westkarana.com/images/noff/tofs.jpg">\r\n\r\nAnother pic from one of our many ToFS 4th floor runs while BC mapped the place.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://westkarana.com/images/noff/pok.jpg">\r\n\r\nGood old PoK! Weird to think that in all pics but the last one, I still played a druid as my main. I went through rogue and cleric, but you have always been a rogue. You and Anavrin made me want to be one too :)\r\n

**Kanad** writes: Heh, I totally missed that it said Inktu'ta under the logo :P The guild I was part of imploded before we got far along in Gates of Discord so it didn't ring a bell :( I miss the old days though.

**Tipa** writes: I wonder how many people from the old days are still lurking around? I get the sense that a lot of them probably have quit MMOs because they took up too much of their lives.
