# Shut Up, We're Talking #22

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-03-17 12:49:58*

I had the pleasure of being on [SUWT #22](http://tagn.wordpress.com/2008/03/17/shut-up-were-talking-22/) this weekend. I was first on SUWT #12, so I guess I'll get another chance to mix it up with the crew on SUWT #32!

The fights, the yelling, the smashed windows, the death threats and broken relationships that make podcasts fun, are all here. Our souls laid bare. Tune in and listen to the terror that inevitably occurs whenever someone lets me get too close to a microphone.

We talk about how many billions of dollars would be needed to compete with WoW (short answer by our guest presenter, the Ghost of Carl Sagan: BILLYUNS and BILLYUNS), what game we would unmake (my choice: hopscotch, because what is the POINT of that game anyway?), what we're playing (um, my hopscotch team is first in the league, by the way) and all that drama last week about SOE making an EQ2 community leader into an EQ2 community wiener.

Check it out!
