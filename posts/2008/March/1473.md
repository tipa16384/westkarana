# Shut Up, We're Talking #22

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-03-17 12:49:58*

I had the pleasure of being on [SUWT #22](http://tagn.wordpress.com/2008/03/17/shut-up-were-talking-22/) this weekend. I was first on SUWT #12, so I guess I'll get another chance to mix it up with the crew on SUWT #32!

The fights, the yelling, the smashed windows, the death threats and broken relationships that make podcasts fun, are all here. Our souls laid bare. Tune in and listen to the terror that inevitably occurs whenever someone lets me get too close to a microphone.

We talk about how many billions of dollars would be needed to compete with WoW (short answer by our guest presenter, the Ghost of Carl Sagan: BILLYUNS and BILLYUNS), what game we would unmake (my choice: hopscotch, because what is the POINT of that game anyway?), what we're playing (um, my hopscotch team is first in the league, by the way) and all that drama last week about SOE making an EQ2 community leader into an EQ2 community wiener.

Check it out!

I also thought your un-making of D&D was very thought-provoking. I think people like to game systems, so in D&D everything is transparent while in early adventure games and IF, the numbers are -- as you said -- there, but we didn't need to see them. It reminds me of one of my professors telling me that when he plays MMOs, he likes to turn off the map so that he is much more immersed. It's not that the map is filled with numbers, but it is meta-information that could otherwise spoil an immersive experience. Anyway, good show and good discussion.

Puzzle Quest DOES cheat. Easy mode is more fair because it will actually make a mistake every now and then.. but the option to set it easy is buried and hard to find.

D&Di looks real cool and I had no idea it was coming. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOqxG3u6Foo

Good show I enjoyed it!

Anyway, I'm glad Darren had you on. Y'all had a smart debate the whole way through.

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: Well, the Sims -- like Second Life -- isn't really a game. It's a sandbox; you use your imagination, but there's no concept of winning or losing.

Sims 3 was just announced, by the way. I wonder how that will affect virtual world design?

**[Aaron](http://hallower1980.blogspot.com)** writes: Games can take place in sandboxes. I would say The Sims (The Sims 2, at least... I've never played the first) is different than Second Life, and definitely is a game. As you said, games have specific goals, and they also have rules. The Sims 2 assigns both short-term goals and long-term goals (such as "open a business"), and it has many rules (such as timetables for eating, sleeping, bathing, etc). It also places limits on players' imaginations and creativity (ex: you can steal, but you can't murder). 

I think I can see where you're coming from, though. If the player becomes so focused on exploring the sandbox that she loses track of the rules and assigned goals, is she still playing the game? I don't have an answer, off-hand.
