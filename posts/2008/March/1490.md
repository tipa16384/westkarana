# Confounded Confinder!

There's something supremely, unapologetically geeky about going to a science fiction convention or comic convention. I went to San Diego Comicon back in 2006 and you know, it's just our kind of folk there. Before that, when I was employed anyway (and living in the greater Bay Area), I would hit up Baycon, SiliCon and Fanime every year up in San Jose.

Problem since I've moved to Connecticut is that I had no idea how to find out if similar things went on around here. I found out about Boskone way too late, but then, that's in Boston, two hours away.

This morning, Cory Doctorow wrote about his new app, [Confinder](http://www.greententacles.com/services/confinder/), on [boing boing](http://boingboing.net), and Annalee just wrote about it on io9, so there might be something to it... 

Went there, typed in my zip code -- epic FAIL. [Typed in a zip code NEAR mine](http://www.greententacles.com/services/confinder/06040/) -- SUCCESS! There's one in HARTFORD (the city where I am writing this RIGHT NOW) in August, and the famous Readercon -- for those people who (gasp) like to READ SCIENCE FICTION & FANTASY (as opposed to getting their SF through movies, comics, cartoons or games) -- is in Burlington MA, the city where I interviewed for a job with Digital Research that moved me to California and changed my life forever.

Anyone in the southern New England area going to one of those?
