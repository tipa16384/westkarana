# Giant Bomb: Never fly again.

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-03-19 11:42:26*

A throwaway comment in a Wired.com article led me to [Giant Bomb](http://giantbomb.com), a new game review blog started by [Jeff Gerstmann](http://blog.jeffgerstmann.net/), the [Gamespot](http://gamespot.com) editor who was rumored to have been canned when he gave a poor review to a [game that advertised heavily on Gamespot](http://kaneandlynch.com).

They don't cover MMOs, but I think those of us who love MMOs also spend a fair amount of our time with our Xboxes, Playstations and Wiis want to read reviews where the reviewer isn't shy about admitting that maybe "at one point I thought about vomiting while playing this game".

Can independent games journalism work? They have a bunch of reviews up already, so check 'em out and decide for yourself.

But... I wouldn't want to explain to the TSA what company I worked for. I mean, really. Might as well have business cards printed with "Al-Qaeda in San Francisco".
