Click this and [sign up for the beta](http://www.searchme.com/beta/ars) --

It's a signup for a closed beta for a search engine with a "coverflow" display, looks really cool, goes on the theory that if you could shuffle through the websites returned from a search, you could find the one you're looking for fast.

They only have < 300 beta invites left, and it was a lot higher when I got mine, so I am not going to write a lot about it. Just go get in the beta and let me know how it works for ya.

Thanks, Tipa. About 200 left.

Guess they shoveled more on the pile.

Pretty interesting - though I wouldn't exactly want to use this at work - with this it just shows you those google links pictorially and denies you the option of reading them before saying "Probably shouldn't click there!". 

Seems more useful to use in a "DAMN IT WHAT WAS THAT WEBSITE I SAW YESTERDAY I REMEMBER WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE BUT CAN'T THINK OF THE ADDRESS! *explode*" kind of situations.

Definitely cool, thanks for sharing this Miss Tippy!
