# VG: Missing Eyelids and Malevolent Mailboxes

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-03-13 19:08:59*

I was aghast to find that after Vanguard GU 4 that I no longer had eyelids! Crikey! Was I going to have to go everywhere with a damp cloth over my eyes? [I petitioned](../../../index.php/2008/03/12/vg-can-i-have-my-eyelids-back/), of course, and got my reply this morning.

You can read it below, but take a good long look at that mailbox first. DON'T TOUCH IT! Just look with your EYES, not your hands. Didn't your mom ever teach you anything?

So they plan to give me back my eyelids soon. Well, I guess I can stay awake until then... I hit 'I' to check my inventory, to see if maybe I'd picked up some eyedrops along the way. Instead, I got this message:

Gulp.

Backing away slowly, um, sir...

Did you know Michael Caine (yes ...the actor) is most famous for teaching other actors on how not to blink as you talk to the camera? [Michael Caine: Truly a Class Act](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/michael-caine-truly-a-class-act-not-a-lot--of-people-know-that-746608.html)

Maybe you need some lessons now? Or maybe YOU are the master actor...

lol... I can well imagine my VG character is gratefully closing her eyes whenever I'm not looking at her...
