# EQ2: LFG kicked from the raid.

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-03-11 14:35:55*

The site is loaded right now, so it may be hard to get in, but check it out -- EQ2Flame's LFG was just kicked from the Community Influencer's program, and is [raising hell over it](http://www.eq2flames.com/general-gameplay/22038-how-will.html).

Community Influencers are just that -- people whose opinions of SOE games are influential within the community. EQ2Flames is one of the best places on the web for getting to know the EQ2 community, and is generally full of information you won't find anywhere else. When I started on my recent guild search and (thought) I had exhausted the possibilities on my home server, EQ2Flames was the first and only place I went. And I got results I could never have gotten on the official forums. EQ2Flames is the community site everyone should read.

It's hard to figure out why someone so VERY influential in the EQ2 community would be kicked out of the program unless they had broken an NDA or something heinous like that, but that does not appear to be the case. Not yet, anyway. Instead, they claim a lack of participation and a tendency to sensationalize the negative and harm the Community Management team's ability to do their jobs.

It's a PR disaster in the making.

I'm making some popcorn.
