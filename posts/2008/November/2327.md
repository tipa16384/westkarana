# ShutterCal?

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-11-25 21:18:19*

Anski at [Always Go Right](http://alwaysgoright.com/) blog [wrote today about ShutterCal](http://alwaysgoright.com/2008/11/shuttercal-your-life-in-photos/), a new social site. In this one, you take a picture every day, and post it on an online calendar. Plenty of people doing this on Flickr, but similar to NaNoWriMo, this one subtly nags you to take and post a picture.

I'm not totally sold on the idea, but [I thought I would give it a try](http://shuttercal.com/calendar/Tipa/). Just yesterday and today so far.

Game related? Nah. Just real life. But sometimes, Real Life is good, too.
