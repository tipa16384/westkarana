# EQ2: Game Update 50 patch notes

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-11-18 11:33:52*

Just want to point out (I have a slightly longer expansion article scheduled for later so will be brief) that Kendricke has posted [the Game Update 50 patch notes](http://clockworkgamer.com/2008/11/18/everquest-ii-update-50-the-shadow-odyssey/) up on the Clockwork Gamer blog. Some nice changes. Nothing that makes the troubadour particularly more fun to play, but some nice stuff in there. Mostly just balancing, though.

## Comments!

Giving players a nice little xp boost so they don't have to wade through the same content for the third or fourth consecutive time at a snail's pace while they're leveling alts makes perfect sense.

If I still had my stationpass--or if EQ2 wasn't so many expansions deep in already--this is definitely a game I would be giving a shot.

But yeah, it's very cool.
