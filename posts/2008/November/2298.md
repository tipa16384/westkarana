# How far would I go to play Spellborn?

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-11-20 01:14:40*

Would I order the mainland European version of the game from Amazon Europe? And pay extra for the collector's edition?

Maybe.

Costs less than US$60, so cheaper than a console game.

I hope they let me play it. Why wouldn't they? It's not even going to be out in the US for months. They can cut me off then, if they feel strongly about it.

Or, you know, invite me into the closed beta, but I don't like those odds. I've been sitting in the queue for the European closed beta for a couple of years now.

And anyway, there won't be a collector's edition in the US (or any edition; download only, right?) so no matter how it turns out with the playing, I'll have something to tide me over until next year.

I promise a complete "Unboxing Spellborn" post when it arrives somewhere between Dec 5 and 10.

[TCoS NDA lifting discussion](http://tcos.com/sbforum/viewtopic.php?p=232677#232677)

*One thing I can say is that if you're the sort of person that plays from college or a LAN or simply a busy ISP that experiences fairly regular latency... you're FUBAR. With no auto-attack and no auto-dodge, if you and the server fall out of sync in combat, you pretty much get torn apart.* 

This makes me question using a proxy or even if you do get to connect fully, what type of latency will you get. I usually hit 60ms in AoC, 120 in Guild Wars, but when I played Perfect World in Singapore, I could hit 220+.
The response times for any action in PW was horrendous...and even worse, you could hit a key...wait up to 5 secs before a response.

Do you wish your game time to be scarred by low latency and having a horrible time doing real-time combat?

But, the fact you are willing to support an indie developer is admirable, and I am impressed that you are willing to go to lengths to buy a game we know not that much about.
Luckily the new thread I posted above exists on the TCoS forums, and we at least have some people willing to share now.

I have found quite a few beta reviews popping up, and will post some impressions later..

Good luck.

People in Europe play NA-based games all the time, and maybe Frogster will be adding servers and improving connectivity for when the game goes live?

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: @Edge -- that same thread you posted had a bunch of good comments about latency from people all over the place, including Western Canada. And also described combat as being similar to Wizard 101, but far faster. So I'm kinda liking what I hear. Yeah, performance will be a huge issue if it's a problem.

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: I hope it does. From reading the comments of beta testers, it's just the kind of game I think I would like. A grown-up version of Wizard 101.

**[Sente](http://adingworld.wordpress.com)** writes: Yes, the comments so far sounds quite encouraging. And now there is an open beta also, although only 3 days and not all countries. They ask for country when you register, buth whether they will actually do some checks is another thing.

There are vpn services for europeans that they can get good latencys to the US, they cost about 5â‚¬ a month
I dont know exactly if there is something the other way roung, but i think so
