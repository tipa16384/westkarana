# Live in North America? Want to play Spellborn? No problem!

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-11-19 10:56:04*

[Here's the link](http://www.amazon.de/Frogster-Interactive-Pictures-Chronicles-Spellborn/dp/B001KEMGI4/ref=sr_1_1/276-5856627-6539238?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1227105818&sr=8-1) for Chronicles of Spellborn, Premium Edition from Amazon Europe for 39,95 Euros. Here's the link for [Chronicles of Spellborn](http://www.amazon.de/Frogster-Interactive-Pictures-Chronicles-Spellborn/dp/B001KEMGHU/ref=sr_1_2/276-5856627-6539238?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1227105818&sr=8-2), just the game, for 14,95 Euros.

Just play on the European servers. As far as I know, English will be one of the Euro version's supported languages. If they don't take money from a US address, well, the Euro version of the game will supposedly have the same free starting zones, so:

For 39,95 Euros ($50.44 at today's exchange rate) plus the cost of international shipping, you could get a collector's edition that will probably not be available outside Europe, two free zones to play in assuming you don't get into the Acclaim 'closed beta', and the likelihood you'll be able to play in a far more active and vibrant community than will develop in the US.

Besides, playing as an American in a European game is fun. I've been in a couple of European guilds in EQ. You get caught up in soccer and Eurovision. You get to practice your German and French (and they get to practice their English, which is usually better than that of most native speakers, sadly). Huh? Could be fun, right?

But, not sure what countries....probably just us hick Americans will be blocked (or is it just me that is a Redneck...)

**Sente** writes: They have not decided or announced what restrictions will be in place yet, so assuming an IP block might be a bit premature. 

It is Acclaim that mainly at risk losing here, I don't see that there would be much incentive for Frogster to implement some very restricive schemes - and it is they that would have to do it.

If you can get through to us here, you are most welcome :)

**Tipa** writes: I'm planning on ordering the German version of the game, the collector's edition, and if that doesn't work, then I'll try to finesse my way online...

I'm gonna play this game.

Re: Frogster, it is my understanding (could be wrong) that they were instrumental in finding a NA publisher, so they might well do whatever it takes to support the NA publisher.

When this game is released here, assuming it ever is, I will certainly play on the local servers. But why wait? I cleared my MMO schedule so I could play TCoS when it went live, and I see no reason to change *my* plans just because *Acclaim* dropped the ball.

**Sente** writes: Frogster probably has the better contact network, since they have been around as a game publisher before they took the online path. So I do not doubt that they helped out finding a US publisher. 
I do not quite understand why UK was included in Acclaim's territory though, at least if Frogster is going to have English-speaking servers anyway. Frogster certainly seem to handle that part of Europe when it comes to Bounty Bay Online and Runes of Magic.

But right now I am glad that there will be other English-speaking servers outside of Acclaim-space.

**Tipa** writes: Yeah, it's not going to be able to happen without some sort of proxy to fake being from the EU.

This would just be a lot easier if they would have an open beta like they said they would.
