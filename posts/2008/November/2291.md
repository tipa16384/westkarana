# I feel your pain.

World of Warcraft is a name of power. It summons spam blogscrapers from the mist-filled depths where they lurk, waiting for someone of the mortal world to summon them forth. World of Warcraft. Their noses twitch, their ghastly bone spines quiver, the hunt begins.

I feel most sorry for the WoW bloggers who have to deal with them every hour of every day.

**Tipa** writes: It's so hard NOT to talk about the game. Even though I don't play it, it's impossible to just ignore.

Hmm, I better get to West Karana numbers...hehe...I need some scrape love!

**Tipa** writes: It's just hilarious watching all the trackbacks and pings from Warcraft spam blog scrapers for THIS ARTICLE come in.

Edge, count yourself lucky. Maybe Blogger stops them. Maybe if Wordpress hosted this blog, they'd stop them for me. I'm just happy that Akismet catches most of them, but a couple have gotten through.
