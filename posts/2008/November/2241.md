# Shin Megami Tensei -- the MMO

Just saw that [Aeria Games](http://aeriagames.com) is [adding Shin Megami Tensei](http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/55737) to its stable of free-to-play Asian import MMOs. Brought to the West previously as single player games for the Playstation consoles and known here as Persona, Shin Megami Tensei will be a horror/fantasy MMO where high school and university students battle the forces of evil by bonding with Personas that give them supernatural powers.

I loved the Persona series back on the Playstation; I was really into the Japanese RPG scene back then, and these were some of the best. Twisted, dark plots.

Aeria Games is best known for MMOs like Twelve Sky, Dream of Mirror Online and Pi Story, but with SMT, they could be stepping off to a more story driven direction.

Should be fun, and I'm actually between MMOs at the moment...

**Tipa** writes: Yeah, I had the same reaction :) I just heard about this, so I haven't been able to check, but typically Aeria Games lets any player of any of their games, past or present, into all their closed betas. So if you've signed up with them, you may already be a winner!\r\n\r\nDefinitely checking it out when I get home tonight.

**Tipa** writes: Shows you how expert I am. I only played the Persona series. Yeah, I looked it up in Wikipedia after I posted this and saw that Megami Tensei and Shin Megami Tensei were only related to Persona through certain game elements, and of course, coming from the same team and company.\r\n\r\nThey look like generally the same sort of fantasy horror milieu, though, and I'm still definitely excited about it.

**Tipa** writes: I finished the last current chapter of W101 last night. I'm not playing EQ2 much at the moment because my character is maxed out and I can't take leveling my necro through RoK, EQ1 is one night a week, I only play VG enough to put my characters in action poses for Stout Henry... Most nights I just played Wizard 101 (which is why W101 is all over this blog, and I didn't post everything I did, either :P), but without that, some other game has to take up the slack.

So, I guess one can always hope...but never hype!
