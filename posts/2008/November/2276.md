Apparently Stout Henry has gotten [a job in the real world](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/9/a7/680).

I feel so, so sorry for his clients.

No, I didn't create that profile.

I've heard of one's creations taking on a life of their own, but this is just WEIRD.

Edit: Okay, apparently the OWNER of this place is [Henry A. Stout](http://www.atlanticproperties.com/contact.html). Still pretty bizarre, but at least I'm not insane. Yet. That I know of.
