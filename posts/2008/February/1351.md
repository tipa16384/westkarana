# EQ2: Staying on Befallen!

If you're the same height as a bonsai, you just might be a halfling.

If you can use a card table as a dance floor -- you just might be a halfling.

If the figures on a painting look life sized to you -- you just possibly, might be a halfling.

After a long, long talk with an officer and a discussion of just what my DPS should be, in which SPECIFIC order I should cast my buffs and spells, what weapons I should choose and with me nodding and going 'uh huh, uh huh, uh huh' -- I think I learned more about how to be a raid troubador in those twenty minutes than in a year of raiding -- I was invited to join Delusions of Grandeur, a guild that *transferred* to Befallen awhile back.

They were the number one guild for awhile, but raiding is cutthroat business on Befallen. They don't have as many people as Clan of Shadows, and also they raid with 2-3 troubadors each night (but as I mentioned, they rely very very heavily on troubador buffs, and have different specs for their troubadors depending on which group they are in), so I hope to be able to raid more often.

DoG is pretty close to VP; I understand Leviathon is currently broken -- that's the Tier 3 raid -- so DoG won't be hitting VP until it's fixed.

---

In total, I got nine letters of interest for either my troub or inquisitor in reply to my post looking for a guild on EQ2Flames; plus a nice one from Rao of Gestalt Mind. In the end, I found DoG through the use of the recruiting tool and by grouping with a member on a Maiden's run. I wasn't really looking forward to changing servers, since I have three characters I would have to take at the MINIMUM -- $150 right there -- and if things didn't work out, I'd be left on a server where I didn't know anyone.

Finding a good home on Befallen is a real chore. I hope the third time is the charm. Eternal Chaos imploded, Clan of Shadows rejected... DoG is good folk, and I guess you'll be hearing a bunch about them in the weeks and (hopefully) months and years to come.
