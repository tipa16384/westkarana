# Scurvsnicker's Weekly Recap - 2/18/2008

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-02-19 09:57:52*

It is that time of the week. I got your weekly recap right here: If Scurvsnicker plays 6 days every week, I guess I can call this a good deal. Many Xboxes have it a lot worse. Our gamerscore saw a 30 point boost which is good. Hey it's only 1 achievement... what do you want?

I was also pretty happy about the 2 new games this last week. They were (in no particular order) Rock Band, and Call of Duty 4. I liked them. I think Scurvsnicker did too. Also, I think we can all agree that Scurvsnicker was a FPS junky last week playing a ton of Call of Duty 4. She played it on 6 of the days.

I could go on and on with the stats, but that is enough.
