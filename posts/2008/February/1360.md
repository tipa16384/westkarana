# WoW: I bet you can't win 200K in Warhammer...

Sure, Warhammer may have grand battles to decide the future of realms, war everywhere, skies dark with the fires of pillaged cities... but do you win money when you gank a newb?

World of Warcraft [announced a new Tournament server](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/?p=1130) where, for $20, you can create a new level 70 character from scratch and participate in 3v3 Arena matches and if you're good enough, advance through regionals to become the best PvPers in the world.

It's amazing. At a cost of virtually nothing to a mega-rich company like Blizzard, they have totally trumped Warhammer before it is even released. PvP on Warhammer might be fun, sure. But PvP in WoW can make you famous and rich.

What can EA/Mythic possibly do but match this? Blizzard may just have changed forever how we think of PvP MMOs.
