Thanks to Emily from Neopets who kept working with me until I remembered enough details of what I had in Neopets so that she could send me the info I needed to log in again.

Spitefur is staying in a luxury hotel the next five days until she gets back to good health.

Now to take a look at Shapeshifter again...

Weirdly enough, I got a letter from someone I didn't know asking that I take better care of my Xweetok. I used to be one of the top scorers in Shapeshifter, and they probably looked in on me and saw how poorly Spitefur was being treated.

It cuts the noise of the drums by over half, AND feels better, too. 

I highly recommend the mod. I went with the colored felt, but the black felt looks good too. It was cheap and easy.

Thanks!
