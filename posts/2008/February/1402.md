As I was talking to the lady who starts the raid portion of my epic, I turned and saw... this.

EQ2 is such a beautiful game.

Sometimes it's the little things.

I usually run around with the Profit UI's "Quality" setting, and I switch it down to "Performance" for raids, which still looks pretty good. That's the "Quality" setting in the screenshot. I didn't want to go to screenshot setting (which would have taken care of the aliasing around her wings) because I wanted to get that shot before the lighting changed.

You should see Fear.

Oh crap, that reminds me. There was a lot of talk in the quest text about the disassembly of the demiplanes of Music and Torment. I'll have to go looking for that. I was going to save that for when I was talking about this quest and not just the screenshot but I totally forgot. Apparently, Saryrn left the Plane of Torment to two demigods I'd never heard of. And since I never did the Ayonae Ro or Performer fights in the Theater of Blood (though I am flagged, if any kind guild wants to take me along on one!), I missed out on all that lore, so I don't know if the new lore about Ayonae and the Plane of Music for my epic is different at all than that in EQ1.
