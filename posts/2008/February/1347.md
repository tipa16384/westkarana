# EQ: Has Anybody Seen My Corpse? The Best of EverQuest

Famed Japanese EQ guild Guild Mirage made a Flash video for Electric Funstuff's song about one of EverQuest's most remembered vocations -- looking for your corpse.

If you never played EQ1, maybe this will show... a little... how extreme hardships can bring people together. Of course, there are those who say games shouldn't bring hardships :)

It was several popular songs rewritten to be tailored to EQ 1 - the one that sticks out in my mind the most is "If I had a Million Platinum".

I also remember another clip from the same (CD? Album? What do I call this!) in which a wood elf of some kind prepared for a raid on Castle Mistmoore. It was lots of "GET PUMPED" kind of music, and the wood elf saying "YEA! WE'RE GONNA KILL THEM ALL! BEST RAID EVER TONIGHT! THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT"

It lingered for a bit, but was generally entertaining, and then at some point the raid is pumped up enough and the wood elf yells "CHAAAAAAARRRGGEEE" you hear about 3 foot steps and then a WUMP sort of noise. Then a few expletives.

A long raspy groan slowly picks up volume "aaaaaaaaauuuuuUUUGGGGGGHHHHH" over which the wood elf can be heard saying "Damn, sorry Mayong for....kicking you in the balls..."
