# Your Wednesday Science Update

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-02-20 11:59:00*

This just in: A fictional SF drama with ghosts, time displacement, smoke monsters, numerology, and psychics uses satellite phones [not available in the real world](http://www.livescience.com/technology/080220-lost-phones.html).

We now return you to CSI: Miami, where forensic pathologists using real-world techniques get a full color picture of a man by zooming in on the reflection on the eyeball of someone whose picture was snapped by an ATM machine.

## Comments!

Somehow I doubt that the average atm security camera has either the optics or the resolution to do it however so your point still stands.
