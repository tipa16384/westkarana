You think you're strong. You think you can play the game without using RMT. Gonna game Aeria, gonna take all their stuff and give nothing back, cuz FREE means FREE, dunnit?

Then they come out and say they will give you THREE MONTHS of double experience, starting when you give the word... PLUS a MECHA COSTUME... if you buy that potion between this noon and the next.

OMG. EVIL.

There you have it. (Am I shilling for Aeria? Not unless they pay me!)

If Free Realms takes off, SOE is gonna make a mint on stuff like this. I hope they spring for a decent marketing effort. SOE games are so incredibly stealth. Plus, they're really late to market for games like this...
