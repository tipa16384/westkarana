# Where is SPELLBORN already?

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-08-06 13:46:47*

My constant trolling over on the [Chronicles of Spellborn](http://tcos.com) forums have as yet revealed no news about any North American release. They are supposed to be on the verge of open beta, and to have signed a letter of intent months ago with an unnamed US publisher (my guess, again: [Aeria Games](http://aeriagames.com)).

However, the Spellborn computer they collaborated with German PC makers Ultraforce on earlier this year, [they are now releasing case-only](http://tcos.com/sbforum/viewtopic.php?t=13769), in case you're not jazzed about the computer they had, but loved their case. 249 Euros, so US$384, probably closer to US$500 when all shipping and customs fees are paid, which is pretty expensive just for a case. Just not worth it to buy things from Europe when you live in the US any more.

When I asked, "2009?" he grew quite indignant and said he meant March of this year.  Yeah.\r\n\r\nNow, even allowing for language issues, I'm still putting this one on the list with Hero's Journey and Darkfall.  I will believe it when I see it on the shelf at Fry's.

I like the aspect of combat, and want to really see it in action.\r\nThe graphics throw me off ( I like my characters to look "awesome" and "realistic")...but, who knows, until I see it.\r\n\r\nAh well, until I hear more, I just try not to think about it\r\n\r\nCheers

**Tipa** writes: I just hope that when it does finally arrive, it lives up to its hype. That combat system is really exciting.

**Tipa** writes: Acclaim??? Okay, that came out of nowhere.\r\n\r\nOut of all the MMO importers in the US, I think Acclaim is the least known. It was only on my radar for the David Perry thing.\r\n\r\nWell, good, I'm glad we have a real name for it. Now, from what I understand, all they have to do is put the fun in.\r\n\r\nThanks for the heads-up :)
