[Aeria "of course we will publish your free-to-play MMO for you" Games](http://aeriagames.com) has just announced that their free-to-play Diablo-like, [Cronous](http://cronous.aeriagames.com/), has just entered closed beta. More news later after I have had a chance to take a look, or [sign up for the beta](http://cronous.aeriagames.com/) and see for yourself :)

Guild Wars FTW!

Diablo did have one of the best UI though - it's minimalistic and intuitive, and I'm glad they carried that aspect of it forward.

**fatfoogoo** writes: Has anyone actually played the game yet though? Cow Nose mentions 'Will this finally be an Aeria game worth playing', and there's no response. We're quite interested in this title as well, but haven't given it a whirl yet. Any thoughts?
