# Would you play an MMO where nobody held your hand?

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-08-19 14:10:29*

It's already started on some of the larger MMO sites, but with the dropping of the WAR NDA, every WAR fan blog will fall all over themselves to provide, in great and explicit detail, everything you need to do, and in what order, locations provided, animated overlays to show you in what direction you should face, a comfy chair with wheels on it pushed by a kind old man with an English accent, lit signs floating in front of you saying "OKAY PRESS THAT BUTTON RIGHT NOW!", and all so you won't have to ever have to think you are experiencing Warhammer's world with anything less than complete knowledge.

When this was done in WoW -> BETA <-, I considered the game pre-ruined by too much knowledge. Where's the sensawunda?

But it's much, much MUCH worse now. And I'm sure these posts outlining everything you do are incredibly popular. People are excited about starting a new game, sure, I understand that. But when the new players come into the world and find out there is nothing left to discover, that even by creating a character they have stepped on a well-trod path that has been mapped out by thousands, that there are no secrets -- will they still want to play what has suddenly become just another button pressing finger exercise?
