# EQ2: New clothes for old tailors

Just a taste of the new low level crafted outfits. They add bunches of colors for all tiers, and some real choices for leather and cloth wearers --- up there are some of the choices, including some vest styles for even more options. You won't have to be look boring if you're a caster.

Lots, lots more!

(Is it just me or do those look like they are wearing [pickelhaub](http://www.glosk.com/US/Liberty%20Monument/10549869/photos/Pickelhaub/24452_en.htm) (even though I know they're not. Probably)?

But then, most everyone got there Thursday and a lot of stuff happened Friday, but I didn't show until Saturday. Next time, if there is a next time, I will make sure to arrange to go for the entire thing.

I heard something about an epic dungeon for crafters in the next expansion.

Do you have any more info on that?

Thanks in advance

**Tipa** writes: Yes, there are three crafter missions, for up to a full group of CRAFTERS. Not a killing mission, these are CRAFTING missions and are the very first ones in any game EVER. I wrote about them [in an article for Massively](http://www.massively.com/2008/08/19/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-shadow-odyssey/).

Very interesting read. I just sent it to my sister-in-law and my future brother-in-law (both of whom helped start our guild on Kithicor)... Gotta dangle the carrot in front of them so they'll come back to play :)

Anyway, just wanted to poke my head in and say GREAT WORK and I miss you guys :(
