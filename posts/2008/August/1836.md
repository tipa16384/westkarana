# New hot zones for EverQuest

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-08-20 19:02:03*

As expected, SOE has made a whole new set of hot zones for nearly all levels. There are some old favorites, and a couple of new ones in the list. Hot zones give a substantial bonus to combat experience, and usually have some unique drops as well to encourage people to come to the zone.

20 -- Lake of Ill Omen -- great zone full of solo and group content
25 -- Feerrott -- The area outside the Temple of Cazic-Thule is particularly good
30 -- Frontier Mountains -- even without the hot zone experience, the Mountain Giant Fort is great xp. With it, even better.
35 -- Tower of Frozen Shadow -- an old favorite.
40 -- Lower Guk -- a great place for a group that doesn't mind pulls of five to ten frogs at a time.
45 -- Wakening Lands -- the thick trees make this less than ideal, but the armor camps have easy pulls and decent loot.
50 -- Old Sebilis -- one of EQ's most popular and largest dungeons.
55 -- Blackfeather Roost -- Not my favorite zone, and having to do quests to go to each island makes this hard to navigate.
60 -- Plane of Storms -- spent DAYS here working on Bastion of Thunder keys, a fun zone with many different things to see and monsters to kill.
65 -- Sunderock Springs -- wonderful quest zone.
70 -- Riftseeker's Sanctum -- great place to bring a group, find a good spot and just pull to the pleasing sound of dings.
