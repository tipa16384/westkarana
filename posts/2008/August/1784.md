# Rock Band Live! On Tour! With real instruments!

Yeah, I couldn't see how they could make a tour of four guys pretending to play plastic instruments on stage and charge for it. But [Rock Band Live](http://www.aeglive.com/tourdates.php?id=19624&detail_type=event) is actually a (fairly cheap, considering) concert by some of the bands who have supplied downloadable content for Rock Band -- Panic at the Disco, Dashboard Confessional, Plain White T's and CAB. They're playing all over the place -- here in Connecticut, they're playing in Bridgeport, one of the priciest cities in the state. Might be fun :)
