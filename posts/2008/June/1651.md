# Etha Gray

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-06-26 09:03:38*

A long time ago, writer and radio show host Etha Gray visited [St. Matthias' Episcopal Church](http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-152190242.html) in Seaside, CA, where I was a lay reader and member of the Bishop's Council. She was such an inspiration that I... well, I named my favorite EverQuest character after her -- Etha Tanglewood. Whenever I saw the name, I thought of her.

Because, I guess, I'd mentioned my character in a post, automated comment spammers scraped some search engine for similar keyword results, and so while I was clearing out my comment spam, came across her name in one of the spam comments. I looked her up and found a link into [one of her books](http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=OAaZdaCJyxAC&dq=etha+gray+prayers&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=MIVZPoNDPF&sig=W_0FMk90fF7b_D78hg2BwAwhgWM&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result#PPP1,M1)... so if you want a peak into a book about civil rights and faith, have a look :)
