DM Osbon over at [Sweetflag](http://sweetflag.wordpress.com/), to commemorate the first anniversary of his blog, is gonna be [giving the presents to us](http://sweetflag.wordpress.com/2008/06/19/countdown-continuescompetition-time/). He's got UEFA Euro 2008 for the PS3 -- world football action -- there's even a cheat mode where you can let England win, from what I understand -- and Boom Blox for the Wii, that Jenga-on-steroids-and-with-exploding-stuff game which is the first result of the collaboration between Steven Spielberg and Electronic Arts. Both have gotten rave reviews.

His competition page goes up Tuesday, so check it (and Sweetflag) out, and good luck!

You could have become DRM Osbon... so count your blessings!
