I spent hours last night running around Norrath on Test, killing stuff and doing quests, just so I could write about [the Void Storms coming](http://www.massively.com/2008/06/10/everquest-ii-gu46-the-void-invasion/) in EQ2's Game Update 46. Is the next expansion The Void? Or is this just a red herring? Regardless, the appearance armor and weapons are kind of cool and there are a lot more benefits besides, and [you can read all about it](http://www.massively.com/2008/06/10/everquest-ii-gu46-the-void-invasion/) over on Massively. Fair warning: You will be doing a LOT of cleansing to earn the nicer rewards.

Last week, I had the honor of being taken to a quick tour of the new 80+ Runnyeye instance, "[Runnyeye: The Gathering](http://www.massively.com/2008/06/10/everquest-ii-gu46-runnyeye-the-gathering/)". Insert "Magic: The Gathering" joke here :P I didn't get a chance to really explore the instance, but even the little part I saw showed that the devs must have had a blast when they designed the adventure. R:tG is this year's Nizara -- awesome loot, but it's not going to be a walk in the park. You can [read all about it](http://www.massively.com/2008/06/10/everquest-ii-gu46-runnyeye-the-gathering/) on Massively as well.

Time was also spent helping my son with his epic (good thing I hadn't transferred my troub and inq to Najena; both were needed), and feeling crappy in the hot weather and falling asleep on the couch while Chime urged me to go to bed (in My Life as King for the Wii).
