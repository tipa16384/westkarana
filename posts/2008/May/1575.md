# Mythos Active Camera Mode... and an experiment.

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-05-01 02:00:40*

Okay, thanks for the info about Mythos' Active Camera mode. This lets you get a little lower down, and lets you use the WASD keys to move around. Q and E to turn. INS to fix the camera (I remapped this to F since I have no friends... on Mythos :). Turn on this mode by going to the GAME tab in options and checking Active Camera Mode and UN-checking Pitch Lock.

But hey, how does it look???? Well, watch this video and find out -- and I even NARRATE it! Yes, my first, deadly step toward video blogging. Except, you know, with just game video.

You DON'T want to see my bedroom.

Anyway. Here 'tis. Enjoy! If you can!



And for comparison, here is what Mythos looks like with the regular camera view, and point-and-click to move.
