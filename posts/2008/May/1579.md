Hard to believe tonight was just the third meeting of our Nostalgia-fueled progression group! We're trying to slow down our progression so that we have the chance to see everything, and we're looking to the Lost Dungeons of Norrath to give us instant, instanced fun, challenges and decent loot.

Gozad was the big winner. He started off as a 17 monk, and quickly won a huge weapon upgrade, a nice cloak and a Legends of Norrath Starter Pack and ended the night a hair from 19. Because of Moors questing, I was one kill from 21 and ended the night about a third of the way through 24 and with a booster deck of my own.

We were again short a tank, and so I tanked for the second group. Props go to Coldheat for keeping me alive so well! Our only real tragedy was when I tested a locked chest and KILLED EVERYONE! It points out just how important having a good class balance is in EverQuest. We could have done so much more, so much faster, and gotten some more loot, if we'd had a rogue.

A couple of the people had never done LDoNs before! Astounding, as LDoN was the expansion that became SOE's love letter to casual pickup groups. You could bring a wide variety of group builds in, from just three players to a full group of six, and the dungeon would adjust itself to the number of people and their levels. The loot was excellent, the experience decent, the time commitment was low, and it was easy to find groups. LDoNs were what EQ meant to casual players until Dragons of Norrath updated it for higher levels and better loot.

Given that we really have no idea who will show up on progression nights and yet still wanting to get out there and have fun, LDoNs are a perfect way to spend the evening.

We started out with an easy LDoN, and then another one. When we heard the other group was doing hards, well, we decided to finish off with a hard one as well. It was a little harder, but Coldheat's "Soothe" spell made splitting difficult rooms easy.

It was a great night :) Next week -- we explore Solusek's Eye.

Stargrace did [an excellent writeup](http://mmoquests.com/2008/05/03/north-ro-ldon-and-nostalgia/) of this, and got it in sooner than I did :) I do want to point out that we are still looking for more EQ1 nostalgia nuts who want to see the old world with friends. We're starting a new progression group on Tuesday evenings, but there's still time to join the Friday group if you don't mind a couple of days of grinding to hit level 20 (it really goes incredibly fast these days). Check us out at the [Nostalgia the Guild Forums](http://nostalgiatheguild.org).
