Om Fox last night, we got to see the judges fawn over teen belter David Archuletta and damn indie-rocker David Cook with faint praise. Really. If David C. were a girl, Paula would have told him he looked lovely. However, DialIdol.com predicts that opinions of the judges aside, David C. has won this by a landslide, based on busy signals of people trying to call in. My own thoughts? David A. has real talent, but I still thought his songs were boring. If he weren't singing them on American Idol, I wouldn't give them a moment of time. David C.'s songs didn't reach out and grab me either, but if I were flipping through radio stations and he was singing, I'd probably leave it tuned there. I thought he should have rocked out a lot more.

And over in the Mythos forums, players are trying to [guess when Flagship Studios will release the new Overworld mega-patch](http://forums.mythos.com/showthread.php?t=18988). It was just promised as "mid week", and the devs are apparently trying to get a grip on some nasty bugs before they push the patch out for testing. I don't know if the Overworld is going first to their test server or the beta server, but I'll find it wherever it is :/
