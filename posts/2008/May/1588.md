# European Nostalgia group starting!

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-05-08 10:42:07*

German EQ player Mohanos is [looking for people](http://nostalgiatheguild.org/index.php?topic=152.0) with whom to start a European-time progression group on the Luclin server.

Those people who want to see EQ from the beginning once again (or perhaps for the first time), but couldn't make North American times... might want to check this out :)

## Comments!
