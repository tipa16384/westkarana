# I promise, this is the last American Idol post (for now)

Here's why you American Idol haters need to take another look. I was an AI hater, but then, I had never actually watched the show. I just hated it in theory; since it was on television (strike one), was popular (oh, definitely a strike two), and focused on people who seemed to bask in songs without a lot of melody (boom, strike three).

Then I actually WATCHED it. Since then I have tried to remember, whenever I criticize something I haven't actually tried, that I could be very wrong.

Here's the two Davids, Archuletta and Cook, opening the show with Nickelback's "Hero":



And here's third place finisher Syesha Mercado duoing with Seal on his song "Waiting For You"
