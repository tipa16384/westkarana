# Public radio's pledge drives...

It's pledge time for public radio here in Hartford, and WNPR is on the prowl for donations. Now, I listen all the time and I am a member, but I can't help but wonder if they would make ten times or a hundred times the money they make now if there was a way to shut them up and get back to the news once you'd paid.

I guarantee I'd pony up the cash every time.
