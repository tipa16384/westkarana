# Rock Band 2 controllers blur the line between real band and fake band

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-07-17 15:06:01*

So, just saw on Engadget that Mad Catz is gonna [take an actual real electric guitar](http://www.engadget.com/2008/07/17/live-shots-of-mad-catzs-full-size-rock-band-2-fender-stratocast/) and turn it into a Rock Band 2 controller for PS3 and Xbox 360. So, real guitar, real size, real weight... except, you know, it's still a fake guitar.

Now, I'm really confused. Okay, you take a REAL GUITAR and make a FAKE GUITAR from it. Isn't that... insane... a little?

Now you know what would be awesome... if it still could be used as a regular guitar -- SIMULTANEOUSLY...

Oh, and also, I don't really like feral cats either.
