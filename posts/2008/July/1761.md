# EQ: Tower of Frozen Shadow, Floor 3

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-07-30 07:55:56*

After some false starts, the intrepid Tuesday group, full (for the first time in a long time) with the addition of Maromi's bard, we made it up easily to the third floor of the Tower of Frozen Shadow, the servant's quarters. Well, I shouldn't say it was easy. Fada and Hakiko kept getting disconnected. But we did eventually make it with all hands, cleared to the butler room and settled in for a nice camp. Alas, things did not end well. The butler room repopped (two zombies) at the same time Bjoern was bringing back a skeleton and an armored shadow. But that skeleton brought friends, and by the time he got back to us, it was a barbecue. And THEN one of the butlers spawned the Enraged Shadow Beast that holds the key to floor 4, the home of the witch Cara Omica (who also holds the key to floor 5, the Wedding). Anyway, it was an unlucky pull and we wiped. But we wiped knowing the keyholder was up for the next floor.

We summoned our corpses and returned to fight our way back. As we cleared the second floor, we couldn't help noticing that our healer, Hakiko, was still stuck at the mirror. Crashed again. So we decided to head up and try and kill the Enraged Shadow Beast for the key, anyway. We managed it with only one death -- mine -- and I got my corpse summoned and rezzed and returned to loot the key with only thirty seconds to spare.

Next week we'll likely just stick to floor 3 and get some more levels (I got two, now level 38) before we ascend to the invisible mobs and pit traps of the fourth floor.

Sorry, no pictures :( Bad me.
