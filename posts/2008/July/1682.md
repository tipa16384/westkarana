# EQ2: We don't want RoK v2.0

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-07-07 11:24:54*

Lars over at [MMOment of Zen](http://mmomentofzen.blogspot.com/2008/07/back-in-saddle-again.html) just got to 80 in EQ2, managing eventually to finish the entirely solo, quest-driven run from 70 on that SOE thought we would enjoy. While there were plenty of people to help with the encounters that required more than one person in the first couple of months of the expansion, the numbers doing them now have thinned considerably. Also, this grind is not something you'd ever want to do again, and so alts often languish at the edge of RoK, because the grind is so punishing. Further, characters who've enjoyed leveling in groups all their career suddenly have to learn how to solo, so quick, fun group xp turns into a solo grind in largely abandoned zones.

As Lars points out, there's a reason we play EQ2 instead of WoW. It's for the groups.

We're all hoping that SOE learned their lesson from RoK and that Shadows of Odyssey goes back to the same model the original game and all the expansions up to RoK used -- a mix of solo and group content, with the group content being rewarding and a viable way to level.
