# Flagship Studios is dead, alas.

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-07-13 03:12:47*

My thoughts and good wishes go out to the folks at Flagship Studios, developers of Hellgate: London and Mythos. Word came today that they've closed their doors. Some rumors say their Korean publisher will be taking the games over, other rumors suggest that though Flagship is gone, the employees and IP could be snapped up by some other company.

I can't help but be reminded of Sigil's employees standing out in their parking lot a year ago.I absolutely hope everyone lands on their feet. I never played H:L, but I did play Mythos a lot, and was really looking forward to its release.

It is always bad when I buy your game and don't really play it because I am busy with your free to play demo turned into a side project.
