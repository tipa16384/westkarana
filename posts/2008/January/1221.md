In my forward-looking "[Great Expectations 2008](../../../index.php/2008/01/02/great-expectations-2008/)" piece, I made an 'out there' prediction that at least one movie in 2008 would launch day-and-date with a matching MMO. 

Just a day later, I see on Massively [that my prediction became fact](http://www.massively.com/2008/01/03/disney-investing-a-cool-100m-in-virtual-worlds/) that "Pixie's Hollow" will be released in time to promote this fall's Tinkerbell movie.

So... how's everyone else doing with THEIR predictions? :)
