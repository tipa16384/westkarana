# People I don't like much anymore.

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-01-07 09:03:32*

A little list of people I don't like as much as I used to.

#1: GENJER for addicting me to this STUPID KOREAN SITCOM, GOONG. Gah it's so addicting.

Must be her revenge for me getting her into the IT Crowd...

I was so addicted to this show - it's like korean crack! hehehe I'm just bummed that it's over - I WANT MORE!! Incidentally - I googled the actor who plays Crown Prince Shin and found his my space page. I sent him a note and he wrote back! I was too excited about that. I also found out the actor who plays Yool (Shin's cousin) is a very famous singer in Korea and Japan. The duet you keep hearing throughout the show "Perhaps Love" - he sings the male part. He's amazing. He goes by the name John Hoon for his japanese album, I don't know if R&B is your thing but here are a couple of his songs from youtube:

"Always & Never" by John Hoon

I thought that was supposed to be his twin :P

I'm gonna do plot synopses for Goong as I go through it. It's like a live action anime. So weird. And because the entire series is *actually* a Cinderella-esque fairy tale told by a girl imagining what life would be like if they still had royalty in South Korea, they can play a little loose with reality...

**[Genjer Leigh](http://www.michaelstuartsalsero.com)** writes: Yeah - the one with the different haircolor and was living in london is Prince Shin's cousin. They don't look just alike - geesh. Shin is 6'2" and Yool is like 5'7" for one. lol

I might have to rent this series all over agian. I'm going through withdrawal. 

I'd like to see some other shows the male leads have been in (Shin & Yool) - will have to get you the korean names of the shows in hopes you can find them and burn a DVD of them for me. Netflix is no help in that respect.

**[Genjer Leigh](http://www.michaelstuartsalsero.com)** writes: The next korean show I am going to get you addicted to is "Majimak Chumeun Nawa Hamkke" (Save the Last Dance for Me). This one doesn't become addictive until either the end of the first disc or the beginning of the second disc (but is still an enjoyable watch until the additive part hehe) - but once it reels you in - you're hooked! This doesn't have the comic relief that "Goong' has at times - but plenty of romance, action and suspense.

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: I remember you mentioning it. I'll see if I can find it anywhere.

**[Genjer Leigh](http://www.michaelstuartsalsero.com)** writes: @tipa - Did you ever watch the video links from youtube that I posted? WTF? lol

**[Tipa](https://chasingdings.com)** writes: No, not yet /sigh. I did listen to the song at the end of Goong Ep. 2, which finished downloading (finally) last night.
