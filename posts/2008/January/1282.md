# Death and Command Lines

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-01-21 13:12:30*

Perhaps because I learned last night of the sad [death of Adam Messer](http://www.legacy.com/MOBILE/DeathNotices.asp?Page=Notice&PersonID=101346006), an old friend and coworker from [Digital Research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Research) (of cancer, which claimed both my parents and will likely claim me), I dreamed (as I have before) that I was back there, in Monterey, working at DRI again.

Whenever I return there in my dreams, I wonder what has happened in my life to send me back twenty years. DRI was a great place, a huge family, but we all knew it was doomed. A place of joy and sadness.

Last night's dream ended with me going home because DRI had closed (in my dreams, DRI is always closing up, though I left before Novell bought them and moved the whole thing to Utah). I still had work to do, and when I got home, there was the old amber-screened Zenith terminal I did all my programming with, though luckily the huge bricks of the CompuPro S-100 68K computer weren't around.

That was the last time I ever used a terminal to program. I don't know why I dreamed about it.

Then I see this Craigslist posting about a guy who is looking for a woman with whom to [raise a child in the command-line, Unix way](http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/nyc/485967082.html) :)

I bet he dreams in text...

When I started, the IBM PC/AT -- the computer with the super powerful 80286 processir -- was still a year from release. Our job: Write system software for it.
