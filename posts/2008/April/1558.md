# Nope. I can't do it.

I can't be a full time raider, perform my day job competently, be a professional blogger, play the wide variety of MMOs I need to play to do my job, participate in the two betas I am in (don't ask), and also sleep. The past couple of weeks, sleep-debt has been killing me. Simple fact is, I need to be in bed 11PM each night. Staying up until 1, 2 or 3AM writing after raids is killing me.

The other writers warned me I wouldn't be able to keep up a six night a week raiding schedule. I thought I could, but... well, I need to be awake when I write. I make stupid errors otherwise. So I'll be talking to my guild leaders about cutting back my raiding obligation to two nights a week, or maybe it's time to just go completely casual. I'll never see my mythical epic, but the ordinary one is pretty sweet by itself... and there's always pickup raiding.

Anyway, off to the dentist (yay).
