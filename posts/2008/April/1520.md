# The Terrorists have left the building.

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-04-08 08:49:43*

You know that Chinese restaurant fortune cookie game -- where you open up your fortune cookie, but have to read it aloud and whatever it is, say "in bed!" afterward? Like, "Tomorrow will be your lucky day -- IN BED!"

Hilarious!

So anyway, I have a little variation. Find a newspaper headline, and put it in the middle of "If ---, the terrorists win."

Let's try it with today's [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org) stories.

"If ICANN moves against GoDaddy domain lockdowns, the terrorists win."
"If astronomers locate solar system similar to our own... the terrorists win."
"If Richard Dawkins appears on Doctor Who... the Terrorists WIN."
"If Imperial Storm Troopers skirmish in IP battle... the Terrorist stormtroopers WIN."
"If Yahoo! rejects Microsoft's offer -- gawddammit, the TERRORISTS have ALREADY WON."

Remember, we fight them there so we don't have to fight them here.

**Tipa** writes: @Syncaine - Yes. The American revolutionaries were once terrorists and insurgent guerillas. After they won the war, they were patriots. I want to know what terrorist is pushing all your comments to the spam bin.\r\n\r\n@Keen â€” in the year 2010, the government will make playing WoW mandatory and the fee will be added to your tax bill.\r\n

**Tipa** writes: Gah... I forgot to do it last night and can't from work... the DEFINITIVE sketch on "... in bed" was done by the Upright Citizen's Brigade... or was it Kids in the Hall? Anyway... it slays. I have to try and find it tonight.
