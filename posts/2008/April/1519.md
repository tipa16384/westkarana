# You will want to gouge out your eyes

I'm really sorry. Don't click on the link. It is safe for work, and I feel I HAVE to post this but... you won't like me much after you see [Super Pii Pii Brothers for the Wii](http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/41/superpiipii.html).

The (dirty) mind boggles at the more obscene possibilities. Get Dennis Erectus on the line, he can be the product spokesperson!

I saw an ARCADE game (so like...out in public) Japan had created which was apparently very popular. It looked like a little booth with a big rubber human ass under a monitor. Dangling from a cord was a giant foam hand with only an index finger extended. The object of the game was to simulate the rectal torture of people that gave you stress in your life. I think the choices were "Teacher" "Spouse" and "Boss", possibly others.

But yea, ramming a plastic finger into a plastic ass and watching the pain-spasms of the 3D-rendered faces of the people on screen doesn't exactly seem like something you would consider "family fun".

Japan: Masters of the Rape-Simulator.

**Cow Nose the 50 Pound Cat** writes: Hehe I like the part that talks about girls being able to enjoy the pleasure of peeing while standing up. ^^ Too funny... I almost wonder if this really is a joke, it's so hard to believe, I really can't tell.

**Einhorn** writes: When I go to the urinal I also play this game - only with a reversed set of rules.

**Ally** writes: Gee--with this game I will finally know how cool it is to pee standing up! Thanks, Wii!
