# EQ2: Shard of Hate raid preview

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-04-04 10:59:39*

As I maybe hinted at a couple of posts ago, I've been to the Shard of Hate, which goes live next Tuesday. It's a raid zone, and while there's plenty of perfectly precocious and particularly pretty pictures of the place (sorry), I haven't seen anyone talk about how it will be to actually raid. I had a chance to explore the place with EQ2's lead designer, Akil "Lyndro" Hooper, and though he remained closemouthed about the specifics, he did have some things to say about it, and he talked a little about the future direction of EQ2. Nothing about the expansion, though!

You can read more about it and see pics of some of the bosses [over at Massively](http://www.massively.com/2008/04/04/raiding-lu-44-preview-do-you-feel-the-hate/).
