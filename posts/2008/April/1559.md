# EQ2's next expansion -- The Shadow of Odyssey

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-04-24 09:53:06*

SOE has just registered trademarks for (presumably) the next expansions for EQ and EQ2.

EQ2's next expansion is The Shadow of Odyssey,

while EQ's next expansion is The Seeds of Destruction.

Shadow of Odyssey... well, since Luclin was the shadowed moon and the gateway to the Plane of Shadow was within it, I think I have to call "I WIN" on this one. Given the connections between the Everlings, the Tunarian Throne and Luclin disclosed recently...

We're going to the Moon, Alice. To the fuggin' MOON.
