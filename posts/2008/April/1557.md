I wrote [a piece yesterday](http://www.massively.com/2008/04/21/missbimbo-when-satire-turns-serious/) about [MissBimbo.com](http://missbimbo.com), a game that teaches young girls how dieting and boob jobs are the path to a successful and rewarding life... and on the way to work, what drives by but a truck full of Bimbos... or something :)

Next time you go off for a Sunday drive you won't be the least bit surprised when a big-rig cuts you off featuring the word CUM-DUMPSTER proudly in giant bubble letters with a mincing family of field mice in feety-pajamas hopping delicately through a gumdrop field underneath!

OTOH that whole site feels like a viral for something like GTA or the next Slusho.

Help those young ladies know that happiness and success come from becoming a better person inside and choosing to be happy instead of messing with what your given outside and expecting someone else's approval/affection to make you happy. Showering and deodorant are ok though.... don't get me wrong.

**Einhorn** writes: Yea, leave the "worrying about what's outside" to us men. I might one day start responding to those emails that promise me I can "GAIN 9 INCHES".

You girls have it easy, no woman wants a longer vagina.

Be happy.
