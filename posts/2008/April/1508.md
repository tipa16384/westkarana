# LARPing! Now for regular people like us!

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-04-03 10:47:59*

Wired has probably the [best, most balanced article on LARP-ing](http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/multimedia/2008/03/gallery_larping) -- Live Action Role Playing -- I have ever seen. I've known LARPers, though not done any myself, and to a person, they describe as an incredibly fun activity they look forward to throughout the year. However, media coverage has always taken the kook/geek/deviant/possible terrorist angle. Likely it's easier to make fun of people than to *have* fun with them?

Reading this article makes me want to get a costume, grab a lute (because of course I would be a bard!) and head into the woods to hang out with my kind of folks!

I need to also recommend a book to you if you are at all interested in this sort of thing -- Peter S. Beagle's *The Folk of the Air*. What if playful -- or murderous -- spirits decided to use a hapless and largely unaware LARP war to summon a great evil into the world? Beagle wrote *The Last Unicorn* and *A Fine and Private Place* and is one of the US's greatest fantasy writers.
