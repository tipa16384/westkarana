Nostalgia guildmate Davic brings news of [the latest patch notes](http://nostalgiatheguild.org/index.php?topic=348.0) from EverQuest! I knew the EQ2 GU48 stuff was coming, but I was totally blindsided by THESE!

-- Voice chat now in EQ, same as it is in EQ2 (and can we chat between EQ and EQ2?)
-- Groups can automatically merge if there is room. I have three spots free in my group, so do you, I invite you, one group all together!
-- Coin no longer has weight! No longer can we ridicule people who took out a lot of money from the bank in the Bazaar (where weight doesn't count) and then left the zone... unable to move...
-- Linkdeath timer is now *one minute rather than three*! So you can get back into the game faster...

Good stuff! Read [the full patch notes here](http://nostalgiatheguild.org/index.php?topic=348.0)!
