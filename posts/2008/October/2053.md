# EQ: Do you PLAY EverQuest and also BLOG about it?

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-10-04 09:26:23*

![](../../../uploads/2008/10/eqgame-2008-10-04-08-59-37-85.jpg "eqgame-2008-10-04-08-59-37-85") If I type "EverQuest Blog" into Google, I get pages and pages of plat seller spam, sites like Ten Ton Hammer and Warcry reblogging SOE press releases and stuff. But one thing I don't find are actual blogs about people who are playing EverQuest.

I don't even find THIS blog on such a list. It's bizarre and backwards to me that I can't find anyone -- including ME -- blogging about actually playing the game. I know it's old, but I see bunches of people in game all the time, so I know there must be SOME people blogging about it.

Sure, EQ discussion has traditionally been on the community message boards and on the SOE forums and, of course, on guild message boards (which are usually closed to the general public). So there's undoubtedly a lot of talk about EQ that just doesn't appear on Google. Message boards are notorious for not being friendly to Google.

Anyway. There's always the chance that you're an EverQuest blogger or read other EQ blogs if you're reading this one. So... what's the URL? Because I'd REALLY would like to read about the adventures of other people in the game that really did more than any other to shape the MMOs that followed it.

**Tipa** writes: Blogging is about telling stories to all your friends at once :) What I would like to do, and by linking to other EQ blogs I can help make happen, is keep EQ blogs at the top of search results so people won't have to wade through the Gamespots and TTHs and Warcrys and Stratics to actually find people who really play the game and post about their adventures. You can find the latest EQ patch notes anywhere. Info about how those changes will affect you -- if they do -- that's something a reblogger will never tell you about. SOE gives exclusive tours to people of new content -- when I was at Massively, I went on a couple -- but none of those will tell you how exciting the stuff is.

That's why I am so eager to talk to other EQ bloggers!

**Ogrebears** writes: Well it is the way the google algorithm works. What you will find for "generic" eq2/eq term, the larger site with more clicks tend to be on top. But if you look for something specific eq2/eq term blogs tend to be in the front. For instance "anashti sul" My site and your site show up on the first page for that.

"shadow odyssey beta" Your listed as #1, then MmoQuests.com, then my self... then SOE.....

**Openedge1** writes: I wonder if this has anything to do with 22+ blogs on your roll discussing,,,Warhammer..
60%+ of your roll is about a game you are not playing...

The variety is enough to kill.

Still working on mine and working out those uneven kinks...lol.

Good luck with this.

The bloggers on my blog roll are not there because of what they write about, but how they write :) They are fun to read no matter what the topic. I don't have any interest in Age of Conan, but I read every post you write. I doubt anyone else cares at all about Wizard 101, yet I hope what I write about it is interesting and fun to read even to people who don't play it.

If I could find 22+ blogs discussing EverQuest, I would be loudly yelling about that to all the people who condemn EQ for being harsh and unfriendly, when it's neither -- in my opinion. When I read about people playing Warhammer explaining how wonderful it is that people do best by grouping, and that those groups are more or less exactly as they were in EverQuest, it makes me glad to see how the influence of my favorite MMO to this day is still being felt in even the latest game.

Scratch an old EQ player, and right after they explain how and why they left the game and how much better modern games are, they will go on to tell you amazing stories of their adventures, and a gleam will come to their eyes, and their voice will get excited, and they will tell you how sad they are that modern games don't dare take the risks EQ took, that came together, somehow, with all its flaws, in a game that will never be forgotten.

**eddster** writes: I love reading all the blogs i can - reading a blog that references things to EQ however makes me feel like i'm re-connecting with the part of me that loved EQ raiding, and loved every annoying nuance that made the game so great.
I still crave for that sense of how good my avatar is compared to others of the same class... of where my guild stands compared to all the other guilds on the server... of knowing that we got the tactics spot on, on the last raid... of knowing that one more evening of raiding means we can get one person (out of 70+) in the guild their epic... 
EQ was so difficult, that it brought players together closer - like you say, no modern day MMO is willing to take the risk of making their game so difficult as to exclude paying customers.

Nothing comes close to re-igniting that enthusiasm for gaming i had in my EQ days, except reading about other peoples feelings about EQ.

Yet, this is the issue.

All people are playing the new shiny. So, the 22+ blogs are about the new game. 
I know they are enjoyable based on "how" they write. But, right now, the writing is all about the same thing.

But, I read them, as they are well written, and not much else available yet...even though I am searching.

Just like you.

More variety would help is all...I am not "condemning" these blogs, just stating the fact that the majority are all about the same. 

I hope you have some success though..

Good luck

**Loredena** writes: Well, Sisca and I do play EQ (though mostly EQ2) and we even blog about it on occasion. But we're not exactly prolific bloggers by your or Stargrace's standards! I do enjoy reading what I can find for EQ and EQ2 though -- it seems first WoW, and now WAR are what all the easily-found blogs are about.

**wilhelm2451** writes: "I wonder if this has anything to do with 22+ blogs on your roll discussing,,,Warhammer.."

Why am I on the list of Warhammer blogs on the side bar? And why is Stargrace? That would be like classifying West Karana as a "Wizard 101" blog.

**Tipa** writes: She's also on the list as an EQ2 blog. But yeah, that division of blogs really doesn't work for most blogs. Even WAR-centric blogs like Bildo's and Keen's sometimes talk about other things.

**Tipa** writes: I took them out. Mostly I just wanted to make it easy to use the blogroll to find other good blogs about stuff they were interested in. Once my blogroll was all EQ2, but that's changed and now it's impossible to quickly know which blogs would talk about EQ2 and which, Warhammer.

**wilhelm2451** writes: Yeah, I know what you mean... that big long list of blogs isn't friendly and inviting either. I was just appalled to be labeled a WAR blog! heh!
