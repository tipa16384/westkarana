# Wizard 101: Hametsu Village

Finished Moo Shu's first quest hub, Hametsu Village. It's nice to have kinda-safe sidewalks to run around in; there's nothing more annoying than the Marleybone rooftops, where the middle of the roof is safe, most of the time. Unless the mobs have decided to use that roof to turn around, in which case -- grats on being chain-pulled into encounter after encounter.

The night started off with one last Knight's Court quest, in Marleybone. I had to talk to a lady there about her purse. Well, I guess she had borrowed it from someone else, it got torn up, needed to be repaired, was really someone else's, and her purse had been stolen, so needed to defeat larcenous kittens for that one, then re-deliver everything to everyone, and so on -- this kind of quest chain is really common in Wizard 101, and I think the main purpose of this quest series is to get you to run along those traitorous rooftops some more :P

While I was there, I bought an airship ticket to Kensington. Not because I was about to do it, but because taking the airship there was the final airship trip out of Digmore Station, which gave me the Aeronaut badge. Don't see many people with that one, so why not?

Back to Moo Shu afterward.


While working on Hametsu quests, the girl I'd helped with Katzenstein's Lab last week ported into one of my fights, brought an add, and then used the exploit to fade away. I notice KingsIsle has somewhat fixed the exploit; you no longer come back at a safe spot, but just where you were when you 'sploited. Still free of the fight, though.

I sent her a tell, asking her if she had just ported to me and left after bringing me an add. "Yeah," she said. "Sorry."

Yeah, I'm sorry, too, I muttered, as I removed her from my friends list. Then I had to flee an encounter which had become too hard for me to win.

Compare that with Oran OgreWielder, the lower-level wizard who had been helping me with the last of my Krokotopia quests a few weeks ago. He needed help with a boss on Triton Street, so I helped. He asked me how the pig killing up in Moo Shu was going. I suggested he come see for himself.

A few minutes later while I was fighting some ninja pigs, he showed up, and stayed and helped with a couple of fights. That's what friends do! Then he apparently went AFK and got dragged into a fight solo...

Having multiple decks really worked out well in Hametsu; there were a lot of Life mobs, which fell to my prism-heavy (converts life to death magic) life deck; and the mobs from other schools who didn't last long against my more balanced deck. The trick is not to engage mobs where they are mixing different types, like Life trees walking along with Balance samoorai or Myth ninja pigs. Once you find a spot where there's only one type, you can tune your decks for maximum pwnage.

The end fight was against a (YAWN!) troll sergeant. Wow, are we back on Cyclops Lane? So that was pretty dull. Picked up my first book there. Actually, given the design of the arena, you can sneak around and just safely grab the book if that's all you want to do. Fight was simple; don't think I even needed any healing.

Looking forward to the more interesting (ie, PHAT LEWT DROPPING!) mobs.

I started in Tatakai Outpost. Where the NPCs in Hametsu were managing fairly well, though the village was in flames, in Tatakai, the inmates have taken over the asylum and the good guys are forced to camp along the road. The new most fearsome monsters are the horse people. Not centaurs; these are people with the heads of horses and the bodies of people. Reverse centaurs, I guess. You can see one up in Golem's Court in Wizard City and another in the Krokotopia Oasis. Well, now we know where they are from; they are from Moo Shu. And they are red to me, so meeting them should be a laff-a-minute.

Just barely into level 37. No new upgrades, but I have gotten some interesting new hats which I'm gonna try to make into outfits. Moo Shu is one of the larger worlds, so I think I have a good shot at making level 45 before I finish there.

And a bit of a correction: I talked with the Emperor who was lying on his sickbed in the Jade Palace, and he told me that Malistaire had been after him for the key to Dragonspyre. So I guess Malistaire hadn't been there yet. He has the key now, and if I finish freeing Moo Shu from evil, the Emperor will give it to me as well.

**Crookshankz** writes: When you speak of multiple decks are you just purchasing more Decks from the vendor and stacking them for certain schools?  Can you rename the deck?  I've been reworking my single deck as I go.  Your way sounds less time consuming.  And where did you get that mummy krok?  He's very shibby.

**Tipa** writes: Mummy came from Keeper of the Fang in the Krokosphinx. I got it helping someone else. Moral of that story: Always go along when a friend needs help on a boss fight, you never know what you'll find.\r\n\r\nI have five or six decks, each with a different card loadout, though I only use three of them. I equip the one I think I'll need before I get into a battle. Battles with enemies of your school of magic can be aggravating, since they resist everything you toss at them, but, once your power pip percentage rises (mine's close to 50%), you really need to focus on using your own school for every fight because any other school is just too slow.\r\n\r\nThe solution: The Prism card that every school gets that changes their magic to another type. The Life Prism changes life to death magic. My deck for killing Life mobs is filled mostly with Life cards (as opposed to Fire, my secondary school which I rarely use any more), and has as many Life Prisms as I can stick in there. My non-life deck doesn't have prisms, and has some rank 3 Sunbirds in there. A third deck is used mostly for grouping, and is heavy on heals and AEs.\r\n\r\nDon't sell your old decks when you upgrade or find a new one :)
