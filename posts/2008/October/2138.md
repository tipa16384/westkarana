# WK "Friend to the Connectively Challenged" policy

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-10-17 14:18:10*

It's [come to our attention](http://syncaine.wordpress.com/2008/10/17/dear-eq2-bloggers/) that picture-loaded front pages may be unfriendly to those with slow connections. Who knew?

From now on, only the most recent article with be presented in full (to be friendly to those who read this through feeds). When I post a new article, I'll hide all but the first picture behind a --more-- thingie.

This should make WK somewhat faster to load.

Sorry for the inconvenience :)

And for the record, I LOVE MY GUILD HALL!
