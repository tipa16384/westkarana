# EQ2: Dear SOE. Can I sit down now? PLEASE?

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-10-09 15:27:38*

I have a dozen chairs in my houses.

Why can't I sit in any of them?

All you let me do is kneel. Kneeling on a chair -- or more usually, ABOVE a chair -- is creepy.

I can sit down in City of Heroes -- they have different ways to sit depending on whether I am sitting on a chair, a bench, off the side of a wall, on the ground -- they "get" sitting.

If super heroes can sit once in awhile, why can't tired, battered adventurers?

I can sit in Lord of the Rings Online. I can sit in World of Warcraft.

If there's one thing that would make machinema as popular in EQ2 as in WoW, it would be to work a little on the animations. You know, more dances for older races than that weird drunken jig. That's even worse than the EverQuest butter churn.

Please. Let your people sit.
