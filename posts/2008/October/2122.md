# LittleBigPlanet closes the closed beta.

I played LittleBigPlanet right up until they shut down the servers. I even dragged out my other controller and played two sack people at once for some of the co-op stuff. Turns out I was right about why I couldn't fully complete certain levels -- there are trigger stickers, like the star, that you only get several games n to "The British King's" levels.

All were fun. Some were deviously inventive. Exploration is rewarded, and everything you find can go toward making your own things.

LBP looks like Muppets caught in a world gone mad. The sense of realism is amazing. Tilting the controller, using the left D-pad and the shoulder buttons, your characters become incredibly expressive -- if that's what you'd like to do with them. Watching your sackperson struggle and strain to move something large into place, or desperately run after and jump onto a cart that got a little out of control -- is amazing. The game is easily as fun to watch as it is to play.

Due to real life, I didn't get to play LBP as much as I'd have liked to, but my opinion hasn't changed. This is the sort of genre-smashing game that Sony should have had out at launch.
