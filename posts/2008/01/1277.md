# MMO: Five second quiz

Quickly, you haven't much time.

Which game, after a four hour patch, did I have to drop my resolution down from 1680x1050 to 1240x782 to play at an acceptable frame rate, dropped me through the world, attacked me with monsters I couldn't attack back because the game said I couldn't see it when it was right in front of me, have doors that only become visible once I get real close, and rebooted my system for me while I was talking to an NPC?

You have five seconds. Hint: What do you call a multiplayer game you play alone?

Stumped?

I doubt it.

But I don't want to rant about this game, yet. Too many people have. I want to seek out the good things.

First impressions aren't good, though.

Diplomacy for the win, but still reminds me of Oblivion's.
