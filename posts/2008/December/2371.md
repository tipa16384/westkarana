EQ2 is the perfect example of a team that let technical goodies get in the way of making the game sufficiently fun -- and it hurt them, BAD.

They never really recovered from that.

Sure, it looks great NOW and everyone can run it as it was meant to be run, NOW. Why'd we have to wait four years for that, again?

I thought it was kinda weird you didn't mention it.

/Sigh...

You can feel sorry for my kids, who've long ago become accustomed to taking anything I say with a grain of salt :)
