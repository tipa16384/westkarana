The art book is pretty :) Comes with a map and a flyer for the soundtrack CD, too. The art book is in English, the manual is in German, but both are written in a type that is too small for me to read, so I hope neither contained important info.

I haven't installed it yet...

I'm also on Dravhavre (International PvE).
