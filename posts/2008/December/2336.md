Son: "Daddy, where is your...what is that called again?"
Daddy:"Dire bear"
Son:"Daddy, where is your...um - Dire bear? Did he run away?"
Daddy:"No, i just unsummon...erm, I got of him-"
Son:"Where did he go? I don't see him"
Daddy:"Well you see I have this whistle that lets me summon him-"
Son:"What does summon mean?"
Daddy:"Summon means................um - yeah the dire bear ran away."
