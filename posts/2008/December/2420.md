# DOMO: If you're gonna have RMT in your game...

If you're going to have RMT in your game, make it weird, kooky and over the top -- like this Santa's sleigh mount from Dream of Mirror Online. Complete with reindeer (but it looks like the shadow costs extra or something). And me in my Mecha outfit, killing Pus with hydraulic power.

And I want that mount, on a character that is a paragon among evil.

The mecha suit was part of a limited, one-day promotion. I got it because I'd never seen anyone in a mecha suit, and this one looked AWESOME :)
