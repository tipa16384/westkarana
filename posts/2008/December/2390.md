# DOMO's Nude Switch

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-12-08 08:16:23*

Norikue pointed out the possible reason why everyone but me seemed to be stripped to their skivvies. The mysterious check box marked "Show Equipment" in the Options window, which I (of course) had checked.

Here's what part of the crowd near the Eversun teleport point looks like with that switch checked:

CLEAR that switch, and suddenly, everyone's wonderful clothing suddenly appears! And it also answers another question of mine -- which was, how come everyone but me fights exclusively hand-to-hand?

I'm thinking something got mistranslated somewhere along the way...

While I was in game anyway, I got my pet resurrected. 680 gold -- OUCH. And now it's mad at me, so I have to play with it for fifteen minutes or so...

Text on the player stalls got squoze oddly. It's actually readable in game. I must have some odd switch unchecked in Photoshop as well...

It makes sense, it's just kinda weird.

You might want to make a musician for your pet. Their secondary songs are all for pets. Pet buffs, and heals. I don't know if past level 30 if there is a pet rez or not. I just noticed that my pets don't die that much with the heals. The songs will heal and buff the entire group's pets.

**Tipa** writes: Hmmm.... Wonderful suggestion! Thanks! I'll look into it :P My blademaster secondary isn't really doing me any good, since I didn't buy any of the secondary skills for it. They seemed kind of lame.

**norikue** writes: Blademaster secondary skills are somewhat hazardous looking. I didn't take one of them because the chance of breaking a weapon just seemed bad. The other ones that temporarily lower your stats are are good for buffs. Especially if you have the Doctor or food regen buff on you. 

I sort of went nuts in the summer and got all of the jobs. I didn't level them all but most are level 20 or higher now. I've always been a alt nut on games anyway. That really drove people nuts on EQ1...way back in the day that is. You can send me email anytime to ask me some questions about DOMO. If I don't know the answer I can usually find the answer. 

And yes the Aeria RMT market for DOMO gets annoying. Most of that can be bought off other players in their vendors if it's transferable. But I never did see much of a point for costumes. Some are pretty or cute but for playing the game....what's the point? The kids on there really get into it though. Worse yet, for a long time all the costumes slot pieces were temporary (7 to 30 days). Which made less sense in buying these costumes to me.
