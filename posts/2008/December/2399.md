# SOE brings RMT fluff items to EverQuest 2?

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-12-09 12:36:22*

This story is causing a bit of a stir here at work. Yes. At my real life work.

Dunno what this means. I have misgivings about having RMT and a subscription price in the same game (just as I do with Wizard 101, but at least EQ2 has appearance slots).

More as we all learn more.

It was simply a matter of time. Send a lot of money on booster packs, maybe find an in game fluff item you could look up the price for here:

then sell on EBAY!!111!!

Most of the times you win, you get something you didn't want. RMT says, you pay your money, you get what you came for. In that, it's far better for the player, who knows how much they can spend to get what they want, but less good for the loot card market.

But we have some news here!

And than I realized it was more cost-effective to find someone wanting to trade the items for unopened packs than it was to open the packs myself. The only booster pack I received in-game I sold for 25plat
