# Vanguard's character model update? BIG WIN.

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-09-11 19:00:31*

Vanguard offered its Game Update #6 yesterday, finally fixing and updating their character models, something promised pretty much from launch. Worth it? Definitely.

Prior to the fix, my halfling bard had had her eyelids removed, and further changes to the ambient lighting system had left her face perpetually in shadow. Here she is pre-patch and as she appears now; below is a closeup of her face.

Her breasts are bigger, her armor is more detailed and seems made of more separate pieces, and she has a happier, livelier expression. Players don't roll halflings because for their supermodel figures, so not sure what the reason was for that, but all in all, she looks far better than before.

Humans weren't hit as hard with the ugly stick pre-patch, and aside from looking burlier and getting eyelids and a new haircut, Stout Henry doesn't look all that different. Here's the before-and-after to judge for yourself.

So, way to go, Vanguard team :) The game's characters now look as fantastic as the landscapes.
