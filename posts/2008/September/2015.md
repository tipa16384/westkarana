Due to being sick, I don't have a Straight Talk Warhammer today. Look for all the facts you never knew about the Witch Hunter, Monday.

Have a good weekend :)

Thanks for the soup :)

But, honestly. If you can save the world first, then we can have our WAR after...oh wait, isn't it "WAR" then Peace?
I am so confused.
You know a good WAR is all we need to save our economy, so I am of the opinion you need to rethink today's post. 

Save the Witch Hunter, Save the World should be the new Tipa motto!!!!

Maybe some sort of ant hill war underneath some foliage? The details are sketchy at best.

Last I heard the big ant hill was closing all it's banks and the ant citizens were losing their homes, while the little ant hill was wondering what to do with over $175 billion from oil profits. Maybe that little ant hill should send some to the big ant hill that freed them from that evil ant.
Enough ant analogies!

Nice photoshop skills btw!
