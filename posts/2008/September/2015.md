Due to being sick, I don't have a Straight Talk Warhammer today. Look for all the facts you never knew about the Witch Hunter, Monday.

Have a good weekend :)

If you can save the world first, then we can have our WAR after...oh wait, isn't it "WAR" then Peace?\r\nI am so confused.\r\nYou know a good WAR is all we need to save our economy, so I am of the opinion you need to rethink today's post. \r\n\r\nSave the Witch Hunter, Save the World should be the new Tipa motto!!!!

**Sean** writes: There was a good war recently. I think it was under a "Bush" or something. \r\nMaybe some sort of ant hill war underneath some foliage? The details are sketchy at best.\r\n\r\nLast I heard the big ant hill was closing all it's banks and the ant citizens were losing their homes, while the little ant hill was wondering what to do with over $175 billion from oil profits. Maybe that little ant hill should send some to the big ant hill that freed them from that evil ant.\r\nEnough ant analogies!\r\n\r\nNice photoshop skills btw!
