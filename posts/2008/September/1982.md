Seems a few of my favorite people made me feel like blogging is not all THAT important.

So instead I will write about what I enjoy, and have fun (after pulling a small chip off my shoulder).

It is as simple and complex as that.

Hopefully, that will happen. So we can get back to what matters. I've made yet another post on the issue at my blog, but I'm not sure I should have.

Something tells me it'll only make matters worse.

Anyway, welcome back Edge. I honestly mean that, despite what he might think.

If only any of the above written text had any truth...

It was suppose to be all about the games. 

YOU made it about something else complete with personal attacks, not this "discourse" you wished.

Turnabout is only fairplay.

But, no need to discuss that here. That is what WE have blogs for.

Cheers
