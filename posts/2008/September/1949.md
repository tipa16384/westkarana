# Golemizer -- ruling the world through mad science

*Posted by Tipa on 2008-09-16 13:30:21*

From the press release (at work, so just cut/paste, haven't played yet). Looks from the screenshots like an old Super Nintendo-like RPG. You create golems and other stuff and rule the world. Their web page has the standard Albert Einstein-looking mad scientist. What did Einstein ever do to be demonized as the stereotypical mad scientist? He always looked like a kindly uncle or something. Peter Cushing has a kind of chiseled, mean look that would be easy to draw, and has the advantage of actually playing a mad scientist in movies, and plus he destroyed Alderaan... I dunno. Leave Einstein alone!!!! Anyway.
