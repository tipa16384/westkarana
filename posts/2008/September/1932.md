# Hello Kitty Online... yes, it's real.

It's really, really hard to write about Hello Kitty Online without irony. But I have to come clean. I was a huge Hello Kitty fan back about fifteen years ago. Well, DUH, in an ironic way. Because that's the only way an adult can really enjoy Hello Kitty.

Back this spring, Hello Kitty Online had a closed beta which I was fortunate enough to be part of. It wasn't a great experience. I could hardly even play the game, because the patcher didn't work for any of my computers. They began publishing their patches as separate downloads so it became possible to at least play. The game itself was an exceedingly grindy Asian import -- you don't just get quests to kill things, you have to kill FIFTY of them. That's like one of the very first quests.

Click to move, repetitive gameplay just wasn't what I was looking for at the time.

Just like the forthcoming Twin Skies and Free Realms, though, the game itself is only half the experience. All of these games have social networking features and ways to interact with the game through your browser. HKO has a fairly sophisticated video editing tool, an appointment calendar, email -- everything needed to make a fairly good try at being your home page on the web.

Judging by the screenshot above, assuming it isn't from *SNK Capcom vs Sanrio*, which, you gotta admit, would be kinda cool, there have been lots of changes to HKO since I played. For one thing, you couldn't play as a Sanrio-like calendar before. So there's that.

Yeah, I signed up for the "Founder's Beta". I am going to give it another chance to make me a Hello Kitty fan.

BRB after I finish painting my laptop pink... Here's some omake for you all --
