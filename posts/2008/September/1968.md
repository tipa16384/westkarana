# Получите добро скоро, камрад.

Добро пожаловать, камрады. Мы собираем здесь так, что мы будем мочь приветствовать нашего самого нового друга, Openedge, к палате спасения разыгрыша Москва мемориальной. Камрад Openedge, несчастливо, нет в самое лучшее здоровья. Американское общество жестокосердно к такому чувствительному человеку. Кремль имеет полное веру в его быстром восстановлении.
