# GH3 FTW

We gathered at midnight well, 11pm, to get our hands on Guitar Hero 3. Actually. I'm not sure how I ended up there, then. It's not as if GH3 won't be all over every store but, when we were in Gamespot this morning getting .hack/G.U. 2 for my son, I somehow walked out of there with a receipt for GH3 and a promise to be there that night -- tonight -- to pick it up.

The store was fairly deserted. Turns out they opened at 11pm, but weren't giving them out until midnight. Sigh. Back home. Forty-five minutes later, I go back -- line is *enormous*. I deftly take out my DS and start beating the crap out of the Elite Four just to be mean. I reach the counter just as Staravia cuts up some critter with Steel Wing.

Oh yeah, speaking of Pokemon, I caught Mesprit the other day. That squishy critter made me so mad. I finally recruited a Gobat from Victory Road to hold it in place with Mean Look while I pelted it with ultraballs. Moving on...

First set was fun, second set was okay and then... Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello challenged me to a boss battle. He'd play, and I had to copy it (luckily, I was merely on Hard while he had to struggle through Expert). Oh yeah, exxcept instead of Star Power, you get Rock Power or something, and you use that to do nasty things to your opponent. I was trying to keep alive while he kept hitting me with stuff, ending it with a Death Drain that took me rock meter to zero and that was it.

I started it up again, and this time, every time I earned an attack, I waited until he was in a difficult passage and nailed him with it. Just kept attacking and attacking and then he lost, I won, and he and I duoed a Rage song.

That's the secret. Those bosses are going to ruin you unless you do some ruining first.

I ended with The Who's "The Seeker". GH3 also has a coop career mode, so Andy and I can restart tomorrow -- no waiting for one of us to unlock all the songs before we can play them together.

Apologies to the SUWT crew :P But... Guitar Hero...
