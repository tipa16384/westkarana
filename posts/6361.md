#Semi-Annual Blogroll: Sheep may safely graze edition#

I work a full day in the office, then strap my laptop to my back, pedal home and work a full night as well. It's called crunch time, this is the third month of it, and work people pay me to do is taking priority over writing which nobody pays me anything to do. If I were working on a game, I could excitedly drop hints about it, but the only way you'll see what I'm writing is if you need to be bonded. Or you happened to be a bond agent. BUT! If you ARE, well, we've got something pretty amazing for you this summer :)

On the plus side, that picture is part of my commute. One of the bennies about biking to work is that it's more acceptable to just stop by the side of the road, outside someone's house, and start taking pictures. If someone popped out of a CAR and started snapping shots, well, people would stare.

**The Great Sony Hack of 2011**

Big news these last couple of months has been the hack attack upon Sony's PlayStation Network as well as Sony Online Entertainment's customer data servers. This was a crime, perpetrated upon Sony and SOE by criminals, and they have essentially turned my PS3 into a brick, made them the object of a million rants and they are costing themselves and their partners thousands of dollars each minute the service is unavailable. It's just a tragedy.

I feel Sony, though, is drawing this out needlessly. Sony has the best engineers in the world. I can't believe that they couldn't have saved their forensic data and plugged whatever security holes were used to break in in more than a couple of days. I don't think anyone on the outside has any idea why Sony has floated May 31st as a "go live" date. I just don't know.

But I worry. I worry about SOE and their games. SOE just recently had some pretty massive layoffs. After a strong start, their latest MMO, DC Universe Online, tanked on the PC. That can't be good with such an expensive IP. Now that game is looking at a month and a half of nobody being able to play it. PC players have already abandoned it, and PS3 players will be playing some other game. So, DCUO is likely dead now. Vanguard's handful of players can't be expected to stick around, so that game is dead. SWG only had until SWTOR came out to live, anyway; ironically, pre-NGE SWG might have been different enough from SWTOR to co-exist. Anyway, SWG - dead. 

Free Realms -- unknown. I played it for awhile, but the constant money grubbing turned me off. I think kids will be happy to return to it after a delay, where adults might find something better to do. Plus, it had only barely launched on the PS3, so it's ripe for a relaunch. Clone Wars Adventures - minigame portals like CWA can survive global thermonuclear war. They are the cockroaches of gaming.

Anyone who plays EQ is there because of all the games available to them, EQ is the one they want. It will survive. EQ2... and its F2P cousin, EQ2X... will survive, but look for massive server mergers; perhaps EQ2 will finally fold into EQ2X.

For the games in development, Planetside Next and EverQuest Next... I can't imagine SOE will have enough revenue to continue serious work on these games. They have to focus on rebuilding their money properties right now. I feel SOE's best hope is to separate from Sony, lose the mandate to put their MMOs on the PS3, and focus their efforts on a couple of really high performing games. I think it's long past time for SOE to become Verant once again.

**Skype is Microsoft's new MMO!**

The US Navy, via a program at the Naval Postgraduate School which I have totally visited (yay Monterey!), is soon to launch an online, collaborative brainstorming tool called [MMOWGLI](http://mmowgli.nps.edu/mmowgli), which stands for "I Bet I Can Come Up With A Silly Acronym, Leveraging the Internet". Anyway, "players" will be presented with some real world scenarios and will be able to collaborate with others on possible solutions using a graphical tool. Which is great; all the armchair admirals will finally be able to make their voices heard. Someone at work, when I mentioned this, said in response to the initial scenario of dealing with the Somali pirates that are harassing shipping off the coast of Africa, "shoot them all". That could be an option!

I think it's a great idea. I just hate that the term "MMO", which we've come to use as shorthand for MMORPG - massively multiplayer online role playing game - being applied to any online activity involving more than two people. And what I hate more is the professional gaming press jumping on that same bandwagon, [when they should really know better](http://massively.joystiq.com/2011/05/11/u-s-navy-fights-piracy-with-mmos/).

The worst are those places which try and explain that MMOs are games like WoW, [except for this one](http://techland.time.com/2011/05/11/warcraft-for-real-u-s-navy-launching-mmo-game-to-help-catch-pirates/). Kudos to that writer for also trying to compare it to a MUD, which it isn't.

**WoW loses half a million players, attributes it to a rounding error**

So, news comes that [WoW has lost a small percentage of their user-base](http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/05/09/world-of-warcraft-subscriptions-decline-slightly-to-11-4-million-worldwide-new-premium-mount-soon/), a marginal number of players that would total more than the active base of any other subscription MMO in the world.

Upshot is, their two year expansion cycle just isn't working for them any more. People chew through all the new content in a few months (if that), and then drift off to other games, like Rift.

All these years, Blizzard has told us that this is how long it takes to come up with an expansion's worth of quality content. It can't be rushed, hurried or scheduled. It's done when it's done. But, now Blizz feels it actually could churn the stuff out a lot faster than that if it wanted to. It's vowed to push Diablo 3 out the door sometime this year, instead of somewhere in this decade, their previous estimate. There's a new sense of urgency coming out of Irvine, and I feel it's long overdue. World of Warcraft IS the elder game now, and it has to move fast to keep relevant.

It's not about the money -- they have record profits, and if they ever feel they need more cash, they can add some more mounts to the cash shop and make an achievement for buying them all. For Blizzard, it's about remaining the game that people think of when they think "MMO".
