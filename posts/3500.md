# Wizard 101: Arena Season 1 and Automagic

[![w101pvppreview](http://westkarana.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/w101pvppreview.jpg "w101pvppreview")](https://www.wizard101.com/site/home2/wizard101/page_8ad6a4042131e7c401213b7c805700b3)

Sean Emeraldweaver, a Wizard101 blogger from Alaska, wanted me to show his video advertisement for his blog, [Automagic](http://auto-magic.blogspot.com/). Hey, I'm proud to write for Sean's second favorite blog ;) It's wonderful to see so many new W101 bloggers. The game definitely deserves more press!
