# Site maintenance...

I just upgraded to the newest version of Wordpress, so maybe it will stop bugging me about using an old version. I also stopped the random header banner changing. I always thought the actual image of West Karana would be the best one for this blog... it just looks so tranquil and peaceful... y'know, except for the huge spiders, supersized beetles, giants and werewolves, it's not a bad little place.
