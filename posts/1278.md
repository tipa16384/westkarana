# Rock Band: Can you rock harder than a grandmother?

Wanna know if you drum better than me? Now you can find out, if you have Rock Band for the Xbox 360 and it's connected to Xbox Live.

Sit down at your drums, choose Multiplayer > Tug of War > Ranked Match and play about a dozen matches or so on MEDIUM. Check out your ranking. Mine's 27. It's about a 50/50 chance I win if I play another 27. If you're higher than that, you rock harder than me. If you're lower, turn in your drumsticks.

So, can you rock harder than a grandmother?
