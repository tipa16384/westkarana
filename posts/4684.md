# Nemesis Mine: This has got to stop.

![](http://westkarana.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/syp.png "Fallen Nemesis")

It's not that I don't agree with everything [Syp of Bio Break](http://biobreak.wordpress.com/) says, or stands for. Well, I DON'T agree, but it isn't JUST that.

If I said LEFT, he'd say RIGHT. If I looked up at the sun and said it was bright, he'd swear from here to Sunday that it was the blackest night he'd ever seen. He just can't stand seeing me be right about anything. Well, that ends now. Because I AM right. About EVERYTHING.

And that makes HIM WRONG.

Proof? I have proof. I come loaded with proof. I have more proof than a thousand high school geometry teachers. I have more proof than ten Jack Daniels bottling plants stacked one on top the other. I have more proof than a hundred CIA agents in a thousand Guatanamo Bays. I have proof cabinets filled with proof.

Yeah. So let's take things one at a time.

[Post on iPhone apps](http://biobreak.wordpress.com/2010/02/11/iphone-fantasy-gamebooks-and-the-quest-for-nostalgia/)? Well, he has never even SEEN an iPhone, so where does he get off talking about iPhone apps? The only reason he mentions it is because he gets a dime whenever someone buys one. Getting rich from the commercial endorsements, Syp? Hope that new Jaguar was worth the loss of your integrity.

[Quote of the Day from his alleged wife](http://biobreak.wordpress.com/2010/02/10/quote-of-the-day-63/)? He just made that up. You know it, I know it, he knows it. Never was said, never happened. It's his blog, he makes the rules, and rules are WHATEVER.

He wrote [ONE PARAGRAPH](http://biobreak.wordpress.com/2010/02/10/do-older-mmos-get-more-slack-for-being-sloppy/) asking if WoW gets off easy for having crappy patches because it's older and gets FOURTEEN COMMENTS! He wrote them all.

It's true.

Look, I didn't ask to be Syp's nemesis but.... Okay, I DID ask. BUT! STILL! Doesn't mean SOMEONE didn't have to call a shovel a spade here.

Ball's in your court, Syp. IF THAT'S YOUR REAL NAME.
