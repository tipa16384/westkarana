EverQuest II's next expansion is not Velious, as widely assumed based on the (now known to be) red herrings seen in Kunark. EQ2's next expansion, Sentinel's Fate, will bring the island of Odus back to Norrath.

At the same time (but not as part of the expansion), good races will be able to start in the frozen city of Halas, a move widely expected as it brings the number of good/evil starting cities to three each -- Freeport, Neriak and Gorowyn vs Qeynos, Kelethin and now Halas.

Sentinel's Fate also carries with it ten new levels -- raising the bar for endgame activities to level 90.

There was no word on new AAs, but there will be WoW-style achievements, so now you, too, can experience having your tank strip down naked for that "Tanking Venril Naked" achievement.

Yay.

My take: if people want to play WoW, well, look, right over there, OMG IT'S WOW! Go play it.

Did ya like skipping through Fallen Gate without a care in the world because it was grey to you? Auto mentoring is coming -- your level will be adjusted so that even low level zones are a challenge (and give xp and AA, of course). However, the loot still won't be useful.

The next game update introduces the Shard of Love -- Erollisi Marr's plane! This was never seen in the original EQ, so this will be an entirely new experience. I'm guessing there won't be pointless slaughter on this plane -- or I hope not.

Legends of Norrath will be introducing some cool loot cards. One's a dragon illusion -- you float along above the ground. Another, a cloak that repairs all your gear, once per day. That'll save plat for raiders.

Back in old EverQuest, their sixteenth expansion will be Underfoot, as in the Plane of, and Brell makes an appearance. Looks great for such an old game.

51/50 server announced -- progression server close second, talk to them in a couple of months. Special rewards for killing Naggy and Vox server first.

When is the new server, Mayong, going live? It's live NOW -- but only if you're in the Fan Faire. Which means -- those elusive server firsts? Going down tonight in Las Vegas. Sorry, second-come-latelies.
